Dairying is the main source\\n\\nof livelihood for our milk producers, majority of them either landless or marginal farmers. For\\n\\nmaking dairying a profitable and, sustainable venture, it is important for the dairy farmer to\\n\\nadopt scientific practices that would lead to increased productivity at optimum costs. For this\\n\\nto happen, the farmer should be aware of the basic tenets of animal health, breeding and\\n\\nfeeding.\\n\\nJaffarabadi\\n\\nNative tract: Junagadh,\\n\\nJamnagar, Rajkot, Bhavnagar,\\n\\nPorbandar & Amreli districts\\n\\nof Gujarat\\n\\nThe National Dairy Plan-I (NDP-I) has been launched by the GoI with the aim to double\\n\\nmilk production in the country by 2020. This would require focused efforts in the field of\\n\\nbreeding, feeding and animal health, which would increase productivity and optimize costs.\\n\\nIn breeding, coverage of artificial insemination (AI) needs to be increased using disease free\\n\\nsemen from high genetic merit bulls. There is also an urgent need to optimize the utilization\\n\\nof feed resources in order to reduce the cost of milk production through balancing the ration\\n\\nof animals. More importantly, preventive measures to control occurrence of diseases need to\\n\\nbe put in place, which is pivotal in harnessing the full production potential of the animal.\\n\\nNili Ravi\\n\\nNative tract: Originally from\\n\\nPakistan, found in bordering\\n\\ndistricts of Ferozpur and\\n\\nAmritsar in Punjab\\n\\nThis handbook on scientific dairy practices has been designed keeping these requirements of\\n\\nthe dairy farmers in mind. The handbook attempts to provide basic information on breeding,\\n\\nhealthcare, management, nutrition, fodder production etc, based on existing and new\\n\\ntechnologies, along with illustrations. Such information is usually not available from a single\\n\\nsource to the dairy farmer.\\n\\nPandharpuri\\n\\nNative tract: Solapur, Sangli\\n\\nand Kolhapur  districts of\\n\\nMaharashtra\\n\\nWe sincerely hope that the handbook would be useful to the dairy farmer.\\n\\nPART I\\n\\nANIMAL HEALTH AND BREEDING\\n\\nAnimal health plays an important role in harnessing the expected production potential\\n\\nof dairy animals. A diseased animal cannot perform to the expected level. Timely\\n\\nintervention is therefore pivotal in reducing the economic losses due to diseases.\\n\\nImprovement of breeds is also the need of the hour and the farmer needs to be made\\n\\naware of various aspects of breeding to be an active participant of breed improvement\\n\\nprogrammes. With this aim, the Part I of  this booklet is divided into XIV sections which\\n\\nare as under:\\n\\nSection I\\n\\nSection II\\n\\nSection III\\n\\nSection IV\\n\\nSection V\\n\\nSection VI\\n\\nSection VII\\n\\nGeneral observation of an animal\\n\\nBuying and inducting a new animal\\n\\nCare of new born calf\\n\\nDiseases preventable by vaccination\\n\\nOther important diseases\\n\\nTick and fly borne diseases\\n\\nTick, Fly and worm control\\n\\nSection VIII Diseases that occur after calving\\n\\nSection IX\\n\\nSection X\\n\\nSection XI\\n\\nSection XII\\n\\nDiseases that occur due to faulty feeding\\n\\nMastitis and diseases of teats\\n\\nCommon poisoning conditions\\n\\nCommon zoonotic diseases\\n\\nSection XIII Breeding and related activities\\n\\nSection XIV Traditional remedies for minor ailment\\n\\nSECTION I\\n\\nGENERAL OBSERVATION OF AN ANIMAL\\n\\nGeneral observation of certain parameters will\\n\\nguide you in assessing the health status of your\\n\\nanimal which will in turn help you in seeking\\n\\ntimely advice from a veterinarian.\\n\\nTimely intervention can prevent or drastically\\n\\nreduce the losses due to diseases or other\\n\\nconditions. This section has therefore the\\n\\nfollowing chapters:\\n\\nA. Seven questions for a healthy animal.\\n\\nB. Observing basic health parameters.\\n\\nC. Body scoring\\n\\nA. SEVEN QUESTIONS FOR A HEALTHY ANIMAL\\n\\n1. Does the animal react normally to its environment and in the herd or is it acting strangely?\\n\\n(Behaviour)\\n\\n2. Does it carry its head, ears, body and tail as usual? Does it walk normally? (Attitude)\\n\\n3. Is the animal in good condition and is it well muscled, neither too thin or too fat? (Condition)\\n\\n4. Does it eat, drink and ruminate properly?\\n\\n5. Does it urinate and defaecate normally?\\n\\n6. If a cow is in milk, is there a sudden drop in milk production?\\n\\n7. Any other abnormal signs?\\n\\nConsult a veterinarian in case any change is noticed\\n\\nB. OBSERVING BASIC HEALTH PARAMETERS\\n\\nBreathing frequency - (Breathing in + breathing out) is 10-30 times per minute in normal\\n\\nadults and 30-50 times per minute in calves. Observed best from the animal’s right flank,\\n\\nseen from behind.\\n\\nRumination - Not less than 40 times per minute and 7-10 hours per day.\\n\\nRumen movement - Two to three per minute, can be felt by pressing lightly on the\\n\\nupper part of the left flank.\\n\\nAppearance - A healthy animal has a shining, smooth and even coat as well as shiny horns\\n\\nand hoofs. Eyes should also be normal without discharge or tears and muzzle moist.\\n\\nFever - Usually accompanied by rapid breathing, shivering and occasionally diarrhoea.\\n\\nEars, horns and legs are usually cold  to touch while body is too warm.\\n\\nIf  any change is observed in the above parameters or fever seen, consult a veterinarian.\\n\\nBody condition scoring\\n\\nScoring\\n\\nVertebrae at\\n\\nmiddle of the\\n\\nback\\n\\nRear view of\\n\\nthe hook bone\\n\\n(cross-section)\\n\\nSide view of the\\n\\nline between hook\\n\\nand pin bones\\n\\nCavity between tail\\n\\nhead and pin bone\\n\\n(rear and side view)\\n\\nInterpretation\\n\\nScore 1 -\\n\\nSevere under-conditioning\\n\\nScore 2 -\\n\\nFrame obvious\\n\\nScore 3 -\\n\\nFrame and covering well\\n\\nScore 4 -\\n\\nFrame not very visible\\n\\nScore 5 -\\n\\nSevere over-conditioning\\n\\nNot in good health.\\n\\nWill not milk well or\\n\\nreproduce.\\n\\nHealth may be OK. But\\n\\nmilk production low and\\n\\npoor reproduction.\\n\\nHigh producing, but fat\\n\\nmay not be enough for\\n\\npeak production.\\n\\nMay have more metabolic\\n\\nproblems at calving.\\n\\nExtremely fat and will\\n\\nhave metabolic and\\n\\nbreeding problems.\\n\\nDry cows and calving cows should have a body condition score of 3.5 (See chapter on body scoring)\\n\\nObserve your animals closely to help diagnose diseases early\\n\\nC. BODY SCORING\\n\\nBody scoring is very important in assessing the health status of an animal.\\n\\nA low score may indicate diseases or improper feeding while a high score may indicate a\\n\\nhigh probability of breeding and metabolic problems.\\n\\nBODY SCORE-1\\n\\nExtremely thin. No fat in brisket or\\n\\ntail docks.\\n\\nAll skeletal structures are visible.\\n\\nDull hair\\n\\nBody score 1\\n\\nBody score 2\\n\\nBody score 3\\n\\nMay be diseased and survival\\n\\nduring stress is doubtful\\n\\nBODY SCORE-2\\n\\nThin. Vertebrae, hips and pin bone\\n\\nprominent.\\n\\nSome tissue cover around tail\\n\\ndock, hip bones and the flank.\\n\\nMuscle tissue evident but not\\n\\nabundant, health may be OK.\\n\\nBODY SCORE-3\\n\\nRibcage only slightly visible.\\n\\nFat deposit behind shoulder\\n\\nobvious, ideal condition for calving.\\n\\nFat deposit in brisket area.\\n\\nCattle with body score 1\\n\\nCattle with body score 2\\n\\nHook and pin bone visible, but not\\n\\nprominent.\\n\\nBODY SCORE-4\\n\\nSkeletal structure difficult to\\n\\nidentify.\\n\\nObvious fat deposits behind\\n\\nshoulder and tail head.\\n\\nFlat appearance to the top line.\\n\\nBody score 4\\n\\nBody score 5\\n\\nFolds of fat starting to develop\\n\\nover ribs and thighs.\\n\\nBODY SCORE-5\\n\\nAnimal is obese, flat appearance\\n\\ndominates.\\n\\nBrisket is heavy and bone\\n\\nstructure not noticeable.\\n\\nTail head and hip bones completely\\n\\nburied in folds of fat.\\n\\nBack is flat and completely\\n\\ncovered by fat.\\n\\nMobility impaired by large fat\\n\\ndeposits.\\n\\nCattle with body score 3\\n\\nCattle with body score 4 may have\\n\\nmetabolic problems at calving.\\n\\nCattle with body score 5 and above\\n\\nhave high probability of metabolic and\\n\\nbreeding problems.\\n\\nBody scoring would be a helpful yardstick to monitor health\\n\\nSECTION II\\n\\nBUYING & INDUCTING A NEW ANIMAL\\n\\nNewly purchased animals are one of the major\\n\\nsources of infection and may introduce new\\n\\ndiseases into your herd. Once you decide\\n\\non what type of animals you want to rear\\n\\nbased on your resources, purchasing healthy\\n\\nanimals and implementing strict protocols for\\n\\nintroduction into your herd is one of the most\\n\\nimportant components to prevent diseases\\n\\noccurring in your herd due to introduction of\\n\\na newly purchased animal. Determining the\\n\\nage of the newly purchased animal will also\\n\\nbe a helpful tool. This section consists of the\\n\\nfollowing sections:\\n\\nA. Purchasing a new animal.\\n\\nB. Inducting a newly purchased animal into\\n\\nthe herd.\\n\\nC. Determining the age of an animal\\n\\nA. PURCHASING A NEW ANIMAL\\n\\nBreed\\n\\ny A decision on what breed one wants to keep depends on the resources available with\\n\\nthe farmer and the suitability of the breed to the locale. A decision on the breed should\\n\\nbe taken only after detailed discussions with your local veterinarian/Krishi Vigyan Kendras\\n\\n(KVKs)/Kisan Call Centres.\\n\\nSource\\n\\ny Known disease free farms (either govt or private ) where regular testing for diseases like TB,\\n\\nJD and brucellosis are done and positive animals removed would be ideal sources to procure\\n\\nyour animals.\\n\\ny It is better to buy animals from the owners’ premises rather than from cattle markets/shanties\\n\\nsince chances of the animal being exposed to diseases is high at these locations.\\n\\nGeneral signs to observe for in healthy animals during purchase\\n\\ny Eyes: bright, clear and not runny (no discharge), crusty or bloodshot.\\n\\ny Nose: cool, moist muzzle, with frequent licking; breathing should be regular and not laboured;\\n\\nbeware of discharge, coughing, wheezing or irregular breathing.\\n\\ny Coat: Glossy, clean and un-matted, free of ticks/lice, other parasites or eruptions.\\n\\ny Weight: Average weight for the breed; beware of emaciated or thin animals.\\n\\ny Attitude: Curious, alert and contented; beware of cattle that stand apart from the herd, that\\n\\nseem disinterested or that show signs of a bad temper.\\n\\ny Mobility: Walking should be easy and free of limps; beware of slow or uneven gaits or\\n\\nhunched positions when sitting; the animal should be able to rise from seated positions\\n\\nwith ease.\\n\\ny Udder: Healthy; size isn’t necessarily an indicator of a good udder. It should sit forward with\\n\\nprominent milk veins, not sag and not be too meaty. Observe the cow when she walks, the\\n\\nudder should not show too much sideways movement.\\n\\ny Body score: This is an important indicator of the health of the animal. An animal in good\\n\\nhealth will have a  body score between 3-4. (See chapter on body scoring)\\n\\ny History:  It is important to have a record of the detailed history of the animal on number of\\n\\ncalvings, recorded milk yield during previous lactation, any specific disease occurrence like\\n\\nmastitis, prolapse of uterus, ROP, dystocia, hypocalcaemia etc.\\n\\ny Age :  Though not directly related to health, the farmer should also ensure the age of the\\n\\nanimal by referring to its dentition. ( See chapter on aging and dentition)\\n\\nTransportation of animals\\n\\ny All steps should be taken to avoid stress while transportation. Adequate water, space,\\n\\nfeed, water and rest should be provided at regular intervals while transporting, since stress\\n\\npredisposes to various diseases. The flooring should be provided with some bedding material\\n\\nlike paddy straw.\\n\\nObserve proper procedures while purchasing new animal\\n\\nB. INDUCTING A NEWLY PURCHASED ANIMAL INTO THE HERD\\n\\nQuarantine (Isolating the animal)\\n\\ny The newly purchased animal should be kept in isolation without contact with the other\\n\\nanimals atleast for 3 weeks. One should attend to the newly purchased animal only after\\n\\nattending the herd.\\n\\ny Avoid attending to your herd after contact with the newly purchased animal without a\\n\\nproper wash and cloth change.\\n\\ny Carry out routine deworming, fluke treatment (based on endemicity) and vaccination during\\n\\nthe period of quarantine.\\n\\ny For lactating animals, milk the newly purchased animal separately and, only after milking all\\n\\nthe other animals in the herd.\\n\\ny Always adopt an “all-in all-out” system, clean and disinfect the quarantine area before\\n\\ninducting another animal(s).\\n\\nTesting during quarantine\\n\\nThe following tests should be performed while in quarantine.\\n\\n1. For in-milk animals, test for sub-clinical mastitis (SCM)– If found positive, they should be\\n\\ntreated and retested till negative results are obtained. In case these animals do not become\\n\\nnegative for SCM on subsequent tests, they are most probably chronically infected.\\n\\n2. Test for brucella\\n\\n3. Test for bovine TB (bTB)\\n\\n4. Test for Johne’s Disease (JD)\\n\\nThe following regional laboratories may be contacted for further information:\\n\\nNote: An animal testing negative does not necessarily mean it is free from disease\\n\\nFor Northern region\\n\\n1. Joint Director, Centre for Animal Disease\\n\\nResearch and Diagnosis (CADRAD),\\n\\nIndian Veterinary Research Institute\\n\\n(IVRI), Izatnagar– 243122\\n\\nFor Eastern region\\n\\n1.\\n\\n2.\\n\\n2. Joint Director and In-charge Northern\\n\\nRegional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory,\\n\\nJallandhar, Punjab\\n\\nFor Southern region\\n\\nJoint Director\\n\\nEastern Regional Disease Diagnostic\\n\\nLaboratory, Kolkata-700 037\\n\\nDeputy Director\\n\\nNorth Eastern Regional Disease\\n\\nDiagnostic Laboratory\\n\\nKhanapura, Guwahati-781 022\\n\\nFor Western region\\n\\nJoint Director\\n\\nInstitute of Animal Health and Veterinary\\n\\nBiologicals\\n\\nHebbal, Bangalore - 24\\n\\nJoint Director\\n\\nWestern Regional Disease Diagnostic\\n\\nLaboratory\\n\\nAundh, Pune-411 007\\n\\ny The local veterinarian should be contacted for taking samples for the test or testing the\\n\\nanimals (bTB/JD) and for any other advise. Many State animal husbandry departments also\\n\\ndo the tests in their laboratories.\\n\\nProper quarantine will protect your herd from disease\\n\\nC. DETERMINING AGE OF AN ANIMAL\\n\\nDetermining age of the animal is important while purchasing a new animal since the information\\n\\nprovided by the seller may not always be reliable.\\n\\nI. DETERMINING AGE BY DENTITION\\n\\nAt birth to one month, two or more temporary incisor teeth are present. By first month all 8\\n\\ntemporary incisors appear.\\n\\nThe central pair of temporary incisors are replaced by\\n\\npermanent ones which attains full growth by 2 years (thin\\n\\narrows).\\n\\nDentition at 30 months\\n\\nDentition after 30 months\\n\\nThe third permanent incisor\\n\\nerupts at around 30 months\\n\\nof age (thick arrow)\\n\\nThe fourth permanent incisors\\n\\nerupt after 30 months.\\n\\nThe second pair of incisors is\\n\\nfully developed at 3 years.\\n\\nDentition of a 3 year old cattle with 2\\n\\npairs of fully developed incisors\\n\\nDentition at 3 years\\n\\nDentition by 4-5 years years\\n\\nDentition by 6th year\\n\\nBy the 4-5 years the animal\\n\\nhas a full set of permanent\\n\\nincisors. (In buffaloes by 5-6\\n\\nyears)\\n\\nBy the sixth year, the central\\n\\nincisor\\n\\nshows wear and\\n\\nleveled top.\\n\\nDentition of cattle aged around 4-5 years\\n\\nwith 4 pairs of permanent incisors.\\n\\nThe wearing progresses steadily after the sixth year and by the\\n\\ntenth year, all the incisors show significant wear and space in\\n\\nbetween them.\\n\\nDentition by 10th year\\n\\nII. DETERMINING AGE BY HORN RINGS\\n\\nThis is not a good guide and may give only a very rough idea. The first horn ring appears at 10\\n\\n12 months. One ring is added approximately in a year. But at the fifth year, the first three rings\\n\\nmay not be visible and after 8 years, none may be visible.\\n\\nSECTION III\\n\\nCARE OF NEW BORN CALF\\n\\nA calf is tomorrow’s cow. From the health point\\n\\nof view, the life of a bovine is divided into two\\n\\nparts; the first 24 hours, and the rest. The first\\n\\n24 hours of life of a calf is so important that\\n\\nit has a strong bearing on the rest of its life.\\n\\nA calf not provided adequate care in the first\\n\\n24 hours may succumb to diseases or will\\n\\nalways remain weak and an underperformer,\\n\\neven though it has good genetic potential\\n\\nand is provided a good environment. Another\\n\\nimportant reason for losing a calf is diarrhoea,\\n\\nthe management of which is equally important\\n\\ntill such time the cause is treated and cured.\\n\\nKeeping this in view, the following chapters\\n\\nare covered under this section:\\n\\nA. Care of new born calf\\n\\nB. Calf diarrhoea and its management\\n\\nA. CARE OF NEW BORN CALF\\n\\nThe golden hour: The first hour after calving is the most critical period in the entire life of\\n\\na new born calf.\\n\\nImportant points to remember:\\n\\ny Clean nostrils and mouth which helps the calf breathe\\n\\nbetter and help prevent future breathing problems.\\n\\ny Allow the mother to lick the calf clean which promotes\\n\\ncirculation within the calf’s body and prepares the calf\\n\\nto stand up and walk.\\n\\ny Cut the navel cord at a distance of around 2 inches\\n\\nfrom the base with a clean instrument.\\n\\ny Dip the navel (a simple smearing will not serve the\\n\\npurpose) in 3.5% or higher tincture of iodine solution\\n\\nensuring a minimum contact time of at least 30 seconds.\\n\\ny Tie the exposed end of the cord with a clean thread to\\n\\nclose the opening.\\n\\ny Repeat navel dipping after 12 hours. A poorly maintained\\n\\nnavel is the gateway to serious infections.\\n\\ny A new born calf should be given 2 litres of colostrum\\n\\nwithin the first 2 hours of birth and 1-2 litres (based on\\n\\nsize) within 12 hours of birth.\\n\\ny Many calves do not nurse adequate amounts of\\n\\ncolostrum from their dams within the first few hours of\\n\\nlife, and thus they may not receive adequate immunity.\\n\\ny Feeding colostrum after 24 hours of birth may not help\\n\\nthe calf to ward off infections.\\n\\nLicking stimulates the calf to stand up\\n\\nDipping the navel in 7% Tr.iodine is very\\n\\nimportant in preventing navel infections\\n\\ny A calf must receive adequate colostrum to protect\\n\\nit from diseases for the first three months of its life.\\n\\nColostrum is the calf’s “passport to life”.\\n\\ny Hand-feeding new-born calves is therefore\\n\\nrecommended so that the farmer is sure about the\\n\\namount of colostrum an individual calf receives.\\n\\ny De-worming should be done within 10-14 days of age\\n\\nsubsequently on a monthly basis up to the 6th month.\\n\\ny When the animal is 3 months old, contact the veterinarian\\n\\nfor vaccination.\\n\\ny Provide calf starter from 2-8 weeks for better growth\\n\\nand early maturity.\\n\\nExample of a simple calf starter (approx. percentages)\\n\\nMaize- 52 %; Oats - 20 %; Soya bean meal - 20 %; Molasses - 5 %;\\n\\nSalt - 0.5 %;  Minerals (Macro & Micro) - 1.5%; Vitamins  - 1%\\n\\nB. CALF DIARRHOEA\\n\\ny Diarrhoea in calves can occur due to various reasons.\\n\\ny Calves with diarrhoea lose considerable amounts of water and electrolytes.\\n\\ny Diarrhoea and rapid loss of fluid and ions can cause the calf to die very quickly.\\n\\nMANAGEMENT OF CALF DIARRHOEA\\n\\ny Replace the lost water and electrolytes at the\\n\\nearliest - Feed 2-4 litres of electrolyte solution\\n\\nevery day.\\n\\ny The electrolyte solution provided should be over\\n\\nand above the normal feeding.\\n\\ny Consult a veterinarian at the earliest to determine\\n\\nthe cause of diarrhoea and to provide appropriate\\n\\ntreatment.\\n\\nHome electrolyte solution formula\\n\\n(For 1 litre of warm water)\\n\\nGlucose * - 5 teaspoons\\n\\nSoda bi carb - 1 teaspoon\\n\\nTable salt - 1 teaspoon\\n\\n1 teaspoon=5 g (approx.)\\n\\nCalves do not digest table sugar (sucrose) effectively and addition may worsen diarrhoea leading to\\n\\nmore fluid and electrolyte lose. Glucose is hence preferred.\\n\\nASSESSING LEVELS OF DEHYDRATION\\n\\nDehydration level (%)\\n\\nUp to 5%\\n\\n5 – 6%\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nNo symptoms, animal is normal.\\n\\nDiarrhoea, no clinical signs, strong suckling reflex.\\n\\n6 - 8%\\n\\n8-10%\\n\\n10-14%\\n\\nMild depression, skin tenting* 2-6 seconds, still suckling, sunken\\n\\neyes, weak.\\n\\nDepressed, laying down, eyes very sunken, dry gums, skin tenting\\n\\nmore than 6 seconds.\\n\\nCannot stand, cool extremities, skin remains tented, comatose.\\n\\nOver 14%\\n\\nLeads to death\\n\\nThe skin above the eye and around the chest and neck should rapidly snap back and return\\n\\nto normal when released. If the skin remains raised it is considered ‘tented’. The time taken to\\n\\nreturn to normalcy indicates the level of dehydration.\\n\\nCalves showing symptoms of above 8% dehydration require immediate intravenous fluid\\n\\ntherapy, contact a veterinarian immediately.\\n\\nPREVENTION OF CALF DIARRHOEA\\n\\ny Ensure that adequate quantities of colostrum has been fed to the calf within 6 hours of birth\\n\\nto avoid failure of transfer of immunity.\\n\\ny Ensure that the calf is maintained in a hygienic and dry environment.\\n\\ny Ensure udder cleanliness before allowing the calf to suckle.\\n\\nSECTION IV\\n\\nDISEASES PREVENTABLE BY VACCINATION\\n\\nOur country is endemic to many diseases that\\n\\ncause severe economic losses due to drastic\\n\\nreduction in the production capacity. Some of\\n\\nthe diseases are even  highly fatal. Fortunately,\\n\\nvaccines are available for most of these diseases\\n\\nin our country and can be easily controlled if\\n\\ntimely vaccination is carried out in a mass scale,\\n\\ncovering a large proportion of the susceptible\\n\\npopulation (at least 80%). This section describes\\n\\nthe following diseases that can be easily\\n\\nprevented by resorting to timely and regular\\n\\nvaccination:\\n\\nA. Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)\\n\\nB. Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (HS)\\n\\nC. Black Quarter (BQ)\\n\\nD. Brucellosis\\n\\nE. Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR)\\n\\nF. Rabies\\n\\nG. Anthrax\\n\\nH. Theileriosis\\n\\nI.\\n\\nJ.\\n\\nVaccination schedules for cattle and buffalo\\n\\nImportant points to be noted during\\n\\nvaccination\\n\\nK. Common reasons for vaccination failure\\n\\nA. FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE (FMD)\\n\\ny A highly contagious viral disease\\n\\ny Spreads through contact, contaminated water, feed and air.\\n\\ny Disease is rarely fatal for adults, however the milk production, fertility in females and draft\\n\\npower of males are severely impaired for life after recovery from disease.\\n\\ny Usually fatal in calves.\\n\\ny Also affects sheep, goat (usually sub-clinically and are maintenance hosts) and pigs,\\n\\nwhich are amplification hosts (multiplies the virus around 3000 fold).\\n\\nSYMPTOMS\\n\\nFoot lesion\\n\\nTongue lesion\\n\\nDental pad lesion\\n\\nUdder lesion\\n\\ny Drastic drop in milk production and working capacity (draft animals).\\n\\ny Fever and serous nasal discharge and excessive salivation.\\n\\ny Vesicles may be seen on tongue, dental pad, lips, gums etc.\\n\\ny Vesicle in inter-digital cleft may lead to lameness.\\n\\ny Lesions on teat may lead to mastitis.\\n\\ny Loss in condition may persist even after recovery.\\n\\nPREVENTION\\n\\ny Get your animals aged 4 months and above vaccinated once in 6 months.\\n\\ny Infected animals should be immediately separated since all excretions and secretions from\\n\\ninfected animals contain the virus.\\n\\ny All feed and fodder in contact with the infected animal should be destroyed.\\n\\ny All equipment used should be cleaned and disinfected with 4% sodium carbonate solution\\n\\nor as suggested by a veterinarian.\\n\\ny Healthy animals should not be handled by persons in contact with infected animals.\\n\\ny The infected premises should be disinfected with 4% sodium carbonate solution or with the\\n\\ndisinfectant suggested by a veterinarian.\\n\\ny Vaccinating sheep, goat and pigs would control the disease to a better extend.\\n\\ny Informing authorities promptly would enable them initiate control measures at the earliest\\n\\nwhich will help in limiting the spread of the disease.\\n\\nMANAGEMENT OF FMD\\n\\ny Treatment is only symptomatic, the disease will run its course.\\n\\ny Emollients may be applied on lesions to soothe pain.\\n\\ny Contact veterinarian for suitable advice.\\n\\nVaccinate your animals regularly against FMD to avoid economic losses\\n\\nB. HAEMORRHAGIC SEPTICAEMIA (HS)\\n\\ny This is an acute bacterial disease of cattle and buffaloes which usually occurs during monsoon.\\n\\ny Mortality rate may be as high as 80 %.\\n\\ny Germs of this disease survive longer in humid and waterlogged conditions.\\n\\nSYMPTOMS\\n\\ny High temperature, sudden decrease in milk yield.\\n\\ny Salivation and serous nasal discharge.\\n\\ny Severe oedema of the throat region.\\n\\ny Difficultly in breathing , animal produces a\\n\\ngrunting sound.\\n\\ny Animal usually dies within 1-2 days of showing\\n\\nsymptoms.\\n\\ny Buffaloes are generally more susceptible than\\n\\ncattle.\\n\\ny Animals with clinical signs, particularly buffalo,\\n\\nrarely recover.\\n\\ny In endemic areas, most deaths seen in older\\n\\ncalves and young adults.\\n\\nSevere throat and brisket oedema\\n\\nPREVENTION\\n\\ny Segregate the sick animal from healthy ones and avoid contamination of feed, fodder and\\n\\nwater.\\n\\ny Avoid crowding especially during wet seasons.\\n\\ny Vaccinate all animals which are 6 months and above of age annually before the onset of\\n\\nmonsoon in endemic areas.\\n\\nTREATMENT\\n\\ny Treatment is usually ineffective unless treated very early , that is during the stage when fever\\n\\nsets in.\\n\\ny Few animals survive once clinical signs develop.\\n\\ny Case fatality approaches 100% if treatment is not followed at the initial stage of infection.\\n\\nC. BLACK QUARTER (BQ)\\n\\ny An acute disease of cattle characterized by emphysematous swelling usually in heavy\\n\\nmuscles.\\n\\ny Buffaloes usually suffer from a milder form.\\n\\ny Contaminated pasture appears to be major source of infection.\\n\\ny Healthy animals in the age group 6 months to 2 years are generally affected.\\n\\nSYMPTOMS\\n\\ny Sudden high fever (107ºF-108ºF) and the\\n\\nanimal stops eating and ruminating.\\n\\ny Characteristic hot and painful swelling\\n\\ndevelops on loin and buttocks causing\\n\\nlameness. Swelling sometimes affects\\n\\nshoulders, chest and neck also. When pressed,\\n\\na crackling sound is heard because of the gas\\n\\naccumulation in the swellings.\\n\\ny Animal dies within 24-48 hrs of appearance\\n\\nof symptoms. At this juncture, swellings\\n\\nbecome cold and painless.\\n\\nPREVENTION\\n\\nSwelling on legs\\n\\ny Vaccinate all animals which are 6 months and above of age annually before the onset of\\n\\nmonsoon in endemic areas.\\n\\ny Burning the upper layer of soil with straw to eliminate spores may be of help in endemic\\n\\nareas.\\n\\ny Sprinkle lime over carcass at the time of burial.\\n\\nTREATMENT\\n\\ny Treatment may be effective in initial stages of infection. However in most cases treatment is\\n\\nnot worth the while\\n\\nD. BRUCELLOSIS (CONTAGIOUS ABORTION)\\n\\ny An important bacterial disease of cattle and buffalo.\\n\\ny Leads to loss in milk production, loss of calf, birth of weak or diseased calf ,repeat breeding\\n\\nand even mastitis.\\n\\ny Humans may also get the disease from consumption of raw milk of infected animal or\\n\\ncontact with uterine discharges.\\n\\ny The disease is very much prevalent in India, both in humans and animals.\\n\\nSYMPTOMS\\n\\nJoint swelling\\n\\nAbortion\\n\\nRetention of placenta\\n\\ny Abortion occurs typically after 5th month of pregnancy.\\n\\ny In an infected animal, chances of abortion reduces with number of calvings.\\n\\ny No abortions may be observed after 4th calving, but dam and calf remain infected.\\n\\ny Placental retention may lead to infection and even death of the animal.\\n\\nPREVENTION\\n\\ny Vaccinate female calves (not male calves) between 4-8 months of age.\\n\\ny Only one vaccination is required in its lifetime to protect it from brucellosis.\\n\\ny Any abortion from 5th month onwards should be suspected for brucellosis.\\n\\ny Ideally such animals should be culled. If culling is not possible, isolate the animal immediately\\n\\nfor a minimum of 20 days after calving/abortion.\\n\\ny The aborted foetus, placenta, contaminated bedding, feed etc, should be buried (at least\\n\\n4 feet deep) after a liberal sprinkling of lime. These materials contain very high bacterial\\n\\nloads and if disposed improperly cause the spread of disease by contaminating food sources\\n\\n(pasture, feed, water etc).\\n\\ny Disinfect the shed after isolating the aborted animal.\\n\\ny When the animal is in isolation, disinfect the lochial discharges (which also contain high\\n\\nbacterial loads) daily  with 1-2% NaOH or 5% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution till the\\n\\ndischarges cease (usually by 10 –15 days).\\n\\ny Do not handle infected material with bare hands since the disease is zoonotic.\\n\\nTREATMENT\\n\\ny There is no effective treatment once the animal is infected since the bacteria remains in the\\n\\nbody of the animal. Consult a veterinarian in case of suspicion.\\n\\ny Disease in humans is curable provided proper treatment regimen is followed.\\n\\nVaccinate 4-8 month old female calves once - protect them for life\\n\\nE. INFECTIOUS BOVINE RHINOTRACHEITIS (IBR)\\n\\ny An important viral disease affecting domestic and wild cattle and buffaloes.\\n\\ny There are three forms : respiratory, genital and encephalitic, the first two are more common.\\n\\nThere is a high prevalence of this disease in India.\\n\\ny Causes abortions, ROP, moderate reduction in milk production and even death in calves.\\n\\nInfection can be transmitted through semen.\\n\\nSYMPTOMS\\n\\nSalivation\\n\\ny Coughing, profuse bilateral serous\\n\\ndischarge from nostrils and pyrexia.\\n\\ny Rhinitis, conjunctivitis (one or both\\n\\neyes) with profuse ocular discharge.\\n\\ny In genital form, swollen vulva with\\n\\npapules which later become ulcers.\\n\\ny Abortion is common at 6-8 months\\n\\nof pregnancy.\\n\\nGenital form - Pustules\\n\\non vulva\\n\\ny Uncomplicated cases of respiratory and genital forms usually resolves in 5-10 days. Infected\\n\\nanimals may carry the virus throughout its lifetime.\\n\\ny The brain may be effected in calves below 6 months causing high mortality.\\n\\nRespiratory form - Red nose\\n\\nPREVENTION AND CONTROL\\n\\ny Purchase new animals only after testing them.\\n\\ny Induct only negative animals to your farm.\\n\\ny Vaccination is a method of prevention.\\n\\ny Consult a veterinarian immediately if the above symptoms\\n\\nare seen to prevent the disease from spreading.\\n\\nRespiratory form - Necrosis of\\n\\nmucous membrane\\n\\nVaccination\\n\\nIBR is an emerging disease that needs to be controlled\\n\\nF.

IMPORTANT POINTS TO BE NOTED DURING VACCINATION\\n\\ny Animals should be in good health at the time of vaccination.\\n\\ny The cold chain of the vaccines wherever prescribed should be maintained till the time of\\n\\nadministration to the animal.\\n\\ny The manufacturers’ instruction on the route and dosage should be strictly followed.\\n\\ny A minimum vaccination coverage of 80% of population is required for proper control of the\\n\\ndisease.\\n\\ny It is beneficial to deworm the animals 2-3 weeks before vaccination is carried out for better\\n\\nimmune response.\\n\\ny Vaccination should be carried out at least a month prior to the likely occurrence of the disease.\\n\\ny Vaccination of animals in advanced pregnancy may be avoided even though in most cases\\n\\nnothing untoward may happen.\\n\\nK. COMMON REASONS FOR VACCINATION FAILURE\\n\\ny Lack of maintenance of cold chain from the time of manufacture till vaccination.\\n\\ny Poor immune response in weak and improperly fed animals.\\n\\ny Lack of herd immunity due to only a few animals being vaccinated.\\n\\ny Poor quality of vaccine - Quality will deteriorate if repeatedly thawed and cooled.\\n\\ny Low efficiency or ineffective vaccine – May occur in case of strain variation (eg. FMD)\\n\\nOTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES\\n\\nThere are certain other diseases which\\n\\ncause severe economic losses but cannot be\\n\\nprevented by vaccination since there are no\\n\\nvaccines available . A few of these diseases are\\n\\nself limiting and proper care and treatment\\n\\nduring infection may aid in recovery.\\n\\nBesides these,  there are some diseases which\\n\\nare incurable and the only option is to isolate\\n\\nand remove infected animals from the herd to\\n\\nprevent infection spreading to other animals.\\n\\nThe clinical symptoms are seen only late in the\\n\\ndisease and animals can spread the infection\\n\\nbefore exhibiting any symptoms. This section\\n\\ntherefore deals with the following important\\n\\nconditions:\\n\\nA. Johne’s Disease (JD)\\n\\nB. Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB)\\n\\nC. Mycotoxicosis\\n\\nD.

Many farmers find it difficult to control\\n\\nthe problem. Ticks and biting flies cause a\\n\\ngreat amount of discomfort to the animal\\n\\nand also drain the animal of considerable\\n\\namounts of blood, which in itself leads to\\n\\na significant decrease in productivity. More\\n\\nimportantly, they are also responsible for\\n\\ntransmitting some diseases that destroy the\\n\\nblood cells. Infected animals, if not treated in\\n\\ntime will succumb to the infection or remain\\n\\nchronically ill. It is therefore important to\\n\\nunderstand the symptoms of such diseases\\n\\nso that timely advice and treatment is sought\\n\\nfrom a veterinarian. The following chapters are\\n\\ncovered under this section:\\n\\nA. Anaplasmosis\\n\\nB. Babesiosis\\n\\nC. Trypanosomiasis\\n\\nD. Theileriosis (Refer chapter H of section IV\\n\\nTICK- BORNE INFECTIONS\\n\\ny Anaplasmosis, Babesiosis and Theileriosis (already covered under chapter H of  Section IV)\\n\\nare the three main tick-borne infections affecting blood.\\n\\nA. ANAPLASMOSIS\\n\\ny Anasplasmosis is caused by a small type of bacteria called rickettsia.\\n\\ny Anaplasmosis can also be spread by blood contaminated needles or AI gloves.\\n\\ny Calves are more resistant to anaplasmosis than older cattle.\\n\\ny Carriers exist in endemic areas which act as reservoirs of infection.\\n\\ny Chronically infected cattle may relapse in adulthood.\\n\\ny Fever, fall in milk production, progressive anaemia, jaundice, abortion are the common\\n\\nsymptoms.\\n\\ny In later stages, inappetence, incoordinated movements, breathlessness when exerted, and a\\n\\nrapid pounding pulse are usually seen and animals may succumb.\\n\\ny The disease is curable if treated promptly in early stages.\\n\\nB. BABESIOSIS\\n\\ni\\n\\nii\\n\\niii\\n\\niv\\n\\ny Babesiosis is caused by a type of\\n\\nmicrobe called protozoa.\\n\\ny Fever, inappetence, increased\\n\\nrespiratory rate, sharp decrease in\\n\\nmilk production, muscle tremors,\\n\\nanaemia, jaundice, abortion,\\n\\nconstipation or diarrhoea are the\\n\\ncommon symptoms.\\n\\ny Curable if treated promptly.\\n\\ny In later stages, loss of weight\\n\\nwith haemoglobinuria is seen.\\n\\nNervous symptoms may also be\\n\\nseen.\\n\\ny It is better to repeat treatment if\\n\\ncolour of urine does return to normal by 24 hours after treatment.\\n\\ny Babesiosis is not to be confused with “Red Water Disease” which is an acute highly fatal\\n\\nbacterial disease seen especially in areas with liver fluke infestation\\n\\nTICK, FLY AND WORM CONTROL\\n\\nBoth external (tick and flies) and internal\\n\\nparasites (worms) cause a marked reduction\\n\\nin the production potential of the animal. As\\n\\nalready discussed in the previous section, ticks\\n\\nand flies also are responsible for transmitting\\n\\ncertain diseases. Worms inside the body drain\\n\\nthe animal of valuable nutrients. Infestations\\n\\nwith worms lead to poor growth rate, diarrhoea,\\n\\ndelayed maturity, weakness, increased\\n\\nsusceptibility to infection, low response to\\n\\nvaccination and in severe cases, may lead\\n\\nto death. A little attention in controlling the\\n\\nexternal and internal parasites would go a long\\n\\nway in harnessing the production potential of\\n\\nthe animal. This section therefore deals with\\n\\nthe following chapters:\\n\\n1. Tick and fly control.\\n\\n2. Management of worm infestation\\n\\nA. TICK AND FLY CONTROL\\n\\ny Ticks transmit diseases like anaplasmosis, theileriosis and babesiosis (see chapter on tick\\n\\nborne diseases).\\n\\ny Biting flies transmit diseases like Surra and E fever (see respective chapters).\\n\\ny Heavy infestations may lead to anaemia and significant loss in productivity.\\n\\ny Tick and biting flies cause severe discomfort to the animal.\\n\\ny May cause allergic reactions at the biting sites.\\n\\ny They lay a large number of eggs resulting in further increase in population.\\n\\nVarious types of ticks\\n\\nA tick with eggs\\n\\nSkin allergy due to tick bite\\n\\nI. TICK CONTROL\\n\\nSkin allergy due to fly bite\\n\\ny Any newly purchased animal should be completely de-ticked before allowing to mix with\\n\\nother animals.\\n\\ny Carry out periodic application of acaricide on the animal.\\n\\ny Each adult tick lays around 3000 eggs and the larvae can survive  from 2-7 months , based\\n\\non the climate, without feeding.\\n\\ny All cracks and crevices in the cattle shed therefore should be sprayed with a higher\\n\\nconcentration of the acaricide along with application on the body to avoid re-infestation.\\n\\nFlaming also can be done using a flame gun if available, with a little bit of caution.\\n\\ny The acaricide group should be changed often to avoid resistance from developing.\\n\\ny The acaricide should be applied in proper concentration.\\n\\ny Seek advice from a veterinarian on the appropriate acaricide and its dosage.\\n\\nII. FLY CONTROL\\n\\ny Proper manure and urine disposal on a regular basis. Disposal should be done at a reasonable\\n\\ndistance from the cattle shed.\\n\\ny Any stagnation of drainage should be avoided.\\n\\ny Smoking the shed with raw leaves (neem leaf preferred) especially during evenings would\\n\\nhelp reduce the nuisance.\\n\\ny Fly repellants may be used in proper concentration.\\n\\nNatural repellants like neem oil etc, may be applied regularly to repel both biting flies and ticks. This\\n\\ndoes not have any harmful effects of chemicals and chances of resistance developing are also remote.\\n\\nApplication should be always done against the direction of the hair and should cover the entire body,\\n\\nespecially underbelly and legs.\\n\\nMANAGEMENT OF WORM INFESTATION\\n\\ny Worms are parasites that usually live inside the digestive tract of the host, feeding on tissue\\n\\nfluids or blood of the animal. Worms may also be found in lungs, nasal passage, eye etc.\\n\\ny Eggs are passed through the faeces which contaminate pasture, feed or water sources. Some\\n\\ncause disease in humans also.\\n\\ny There are basically four types of worms : (i) Round worms and (ii) Tapeworms-found in the\\n\\ndigestive tract; (iii) Flukes- found in the rumen and liver and (iv) Schistosomes – found inside\\n\\nblood vessels. (See figure below)\\n\\ny Different treatment regimens are required based on the type of the worm.\\n\\nSYMPTOMS OF WORM INFESTATION\\n\\ny Diarrheoa, delayed age at maturity, reduction in growth rate and milk production,  lower\\n\\nreproductive, draft  and feed conversion efficiencies, lower disease resistance, anaemia etc.\\n\\ny In amphistome (rumen and liver fluke) infestation, severe foetid diarrhoea and sub-mandibular\\n\\noedema (bottle-jaw) may be seen.\\n\\ny Jaundice may be seen in liver fluke infestation.\\n\\ny In tapeworm infestation, pot-belly and moving small white segments in faeces maybe seen.\\n\\nIt may also cause intestinal obstruction due to its length.\\n\\ny Hookworm (type of round worm that sucks blood) and schistosome infestation may cause\\n\\nsevere anaemia and bloody diarrhoea.\\n\\ny Thick nasal discharge, snoring and shortness of breath may be seen in nasal schistosome\\n\\ninfestation. Cough is seen in lungworm (type of round worm in lung) infestation.\\n\\nDeworm your animals regularly – Increase the productivity\\n\\nDifferent types of worms Weak animal Bottle-jaw\\n\\ni ii iii iv\\n\\nPREVENTION AND TREATMENT\\n\\ny First dewormer dose to calves to be given between 7-10 days of age and repeated monthly\\n\\ntill 6 months of age.\\n\\ny Administer dewormer to all animals above 6 months of age twice a year, once at the\\n\\nbeginning and another at the end of the rainy season. Ensure administration on the back of\\n\\nthe tongue rather than into the mouth to avoid rumen bypass.\\n\\ny Adopt deworming on a mass scale to reduce the egg load of worms in the soil.\\n\\ny Pregnant animals should also be dewormed twice, 1st dose near its calving time and the  2nd\\n\\ndose around 6-7 weeks after calving.\\n\\ny If the animal is not responding to treatment, get the dung of the animal examined by a\\n\\nveterinarian to determine the type of worm and provide appropriate drug as advised.\\n\\ny In areas with snail population (water-logged etc), flukes and schistosomes may be suspected,\\n\\nsince snails are involved in completion of its lifecycle.\\n\\ny To avoid drug resistance, do not administer the same drug repeatedly .\\n\\ny For any worm treatment to be effective, the drug must be provided in adequate dosage,\\n\\nconsult a qualified person for proper advise.\\n\\nDISEASES THAT OCCUR AFTER CALVING\\n\\nThere is a huge increase in the requirement\\n\\nof\\n\\nnutrients and minerals in the body\\n\\nimmediately after calving. Unless the body of\\n\\nthe animal is conditioned properly through\\n\\nproper management and feeding during\\n\\npregnancy, there is a high probability of such\\n\\nanimals developing disease conditions due\\n\\nto such nutritional deficiencies which are\\n\\ncollectively called “Metabolic Diseases” which\\n\\nleads to drastic decrease in milk production or\\n\\neven leads to death if timely treatment is not\\n\\ngiven. It would be important to identify the\\n\\nsymptoms of such diseases so that prompt\\n\\nveterinary aid can be sought. The chapter\\n\\ndescribes the following disease conditions:\\n\\nA. Hypocalcaemia (Milk Fever)\\n\\nB. Hypomagnesaemia\\n\\nC. Ketosis\\n\\nD. Post-parturient haemoglobinuria\\n\\nE. Prolapse of Uterus\\n\\nF. Retention of Placenta\\n\\nG. Udder Oedema\\n\\nH. Fatty Liver Syndrome (Lipidosis\\n\\nA. HYPOCALCAEMIA (MILK FEVER)\\n\\ny Occurs due to low calcium level in blood, there is actually no fever. May also cause dystocia,\\n\\nROP and uterine prolapse.\\n\\ny Occurs usually within 72 hours of calving. Initial stage is excitability with fine tremors over\\n\\nflank and loins, ear twitching and head bobbing.\\n\\ny Complete milking during the first 48 hours of calving may precipitate milk fever in some cases.\\n\\ny The animal is unable to stand up and in later stages become recumbent, first with its neck\\n\\nturned to one side and then laterally. Eye reflex is also lost.\\n\\ny In last stage the animal becomes unconscious with sub-normal temperature.\\n\\ny Hypocalcaemia also exists in sub-clinical form with greater risk of the animals developing\\n\\nfever, metritis & ketosis. More losses are thought to occur from this form.\\n\\nVARIOUS STAGES IN MILK FEVER\\n\\nPREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF MILK FEVER\\n\\ny Do not feed calcium supplements in excess during late pregnancy.\\n\\ny Chances of milk fever in prone animals is reduced greatly if given 3-4 doses of oral calcium 12\\n\\n24 hours before calving to 48 hours post calving, with each dose providing 40-50 g of calcium.\\n\\ny Anionic salts like ammonium chloride and magnesium sulphate or ammonium sulphate (50\\n\\n100 g each/day) may be fed during last 3 weeks before calving.\\n\\ny Contact veterinarian immediately if symptoms are seen, animals respond to therapy instantly.\\n\\nIf left untreated, the animal will succumb.\\n\\ny Some animals may relapse within 24-48 hours and require further treatment.\\n\\ny An animal should ideally have a urine pH between 6.5-7 near the time of calving. Higher pH\\n\\nindicates increased risk of milk fever.\\n\\nB. HYPOMAGNESAEMIA\\n\\ny Occurs due to low magnesium levels in blood, adult lactating animals are most susceptible.\\n\\nMay occur in calves also.\\n\\ny Normal animal suddenly throws up its head, bellow, gallop and fall exhibiting severe paddling\\n\\nconvulsions which are repeated in short intervals.\\n\\ny In milder cases animal walks stiffly, is hypersensitive to touch and sound, urinates frequently\\n\\nand may progress to convulsive stage after 2-3 days.\\n\\ny Often occurs along with hypocalcaemia. Untreated animals will die.\\n\\ny Soils fertilized with potash and nitrogen are high risk areas.\\n\\nPREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF HYPOMAGNESAEMIA\\n\\ny Provide Magnesium oxide @ around 50 g per day to animals at risk.\\n\\ny Contact veterinarian immediately if symptoms are seen, animals respond to therapy instantly.\\n\\nMay relapse after 1-2 days which require further treatment.\\n\\nTimely treatment will save your animal\\n\\nC. KETOSIS\\n\\ny Occurs in lactating animals usually during the first 2 months of lactation.\\n\\ny Initially there is slight decrease in feed intake, drop in milk production, lethargy and firm\\n\\nmucous covered dung.\\n\\ny As disease progresses, there is marked weight loss, pica (animal seeks course materials),\\n\\nhumped-back posture. Some even show frenzy and aggression.\\n\\ny Compulsive licking of mangers, bodies, head and nose pressing, chewing bellowing may\\n\\noccur.\\n\\ny Walking may be abnormal with staggering, circling and falling.\\n\\ny If untreated, milk production decreases to an insignificant amount.\\n\\ny Once a cow develops the condition, it is likely to recur in succeeding lactations.\\n\\nPREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF KETOSIS\\n\\ny Proper feeding during late lactation and dry period.\\n\\ny Body score at calving should be 3.5 on a 5 point\\n\\nscale. (see chapter on body scoring)\\n\\ny Sudden change of feed /overfeeding should be\\n\\navoided.\\n\\ny Conditions like ROP, metritis, mastitis, environmental\\n\\nstress  etc should be managed properly.\\n\\ny Contact a veterinarian when above symptoms are\\n\\nseen.\\n\\nWeight loss in ketosis\\n\\nD. POST PARTURIENT HAEMOGLOBINURIA\\n\\ny Recent parturition, heavy milk production,\\n\\nphosphorous & copper deficiency, excess consumption\\n\\nof turnips, rape (Brassica species), sugar beet pulp etc,\\n\\nare considered as predisposing factors.\\n\\ny Symptoms are haemoglubinuria, marked drop in milk\\n\\nproduction, fever, diarrhoea, severe anaemia , weakness\\n\\nand pallour and sloughing of the extremities.\\n\\ny Diseases like babesiosis and theileriosis have to be\\n\\nruled out.\\n\\ny Contact a veterinarian when above symptoms are\\n\\nseen.\\n\\nE. PROLAPSE OF UTERUS\\n\\ny More common in buffaloes than in cattle.\\n\\ny May have genetic predisposition and may occur pre or\\n\\npost partum.\\n\\ny Place the prolapsed mass gently over a clean surface and\\n\\nprotect it from soiling /flies/birds etc.\\n\\ny Do not attempt to remove anything or push the uterus\\n\\nback, this may cause severe bleeding.\\n\\ny Gently wash with saline solution if excessively soiled.\\n\\ny Call a veterinarian for further treatment at the earliest.\\n\\ny Prone animals may be kept with the hind quarter at a\\n\\nslight elevation.\\n\\ny Check the vulval area for any stitch marks before purchasing an animal.\\n\\nF. RETENTION OF PLACENTA (ROP)\\n\\ny Normally foetal membranes are expelled within 3 to\\n\\n8 hours after delivery.\\n\\ny It is termed as ROP if foetal membranes are not\\n\\nexpelled even after 12 hours of parturition.\\n\\ny Chances of ROP are  increased in cases of abortion,\\n\\ndystocia, milk fever, twin birth, induction of calving,\\n\\ninfection and nutritional disturbances.\\n\\ny Never pull the placenta on your own.\\n\\ny Consult a veterinarian to avoid complications like\\n\\nmetritis, septicaemia etc which may lead to even\\n\\ndeath of the animal.\\n\\ny Dispose the removed placenta by deep burial. Avoid handling it with bare hands.\\n\\nG. UDDER OEDEMA\\n\\ny Accumulation of excess fluid in udder and sometimes in\\n\\nthe belly around calving time.\\n\\ny Mainly due to increased blood flow to udder against\\n\\ndecrease flow from udder and increased permeability of\\n\\nblood vessels in the udder.\\n\\ny More prevalent in high producing animals, especially heifers.\\n\\ny Udder is not  painful or hot and should not to be\\n\\nconfused with clinical mastitis.\\n\\ny Predisposing factors may be genetic, nutritional, obesity,\\n\\nlack of exercise.\\n\\ny May become chronic and persist throughout lactation.\\n\\ny Veterinarian may be consulted if the oedema interferes with milking the animal\\n\\nH. FATTY LIVER SYNDROME (LIPIDOSIS)\\n\\ny Fatty liver can develop within 24 hours of an animal going off feed.\\n\\ny This is typically  happens around calving time. Fat mobilisation occurs as a result of negative\\n\\nenergy balance which is exacerbated when off feed.\\n\\ny The broken down fat is then converted back to fat in the liver thus the liver is filled with fat\\n\\neven when the cow is losing condition.\\n\\ny Once fat is deposited in the liver, its concentration in the liver does not fall until the cow\\n\\ngets into positive energy balance, which can be over ten weeks after calving, particularly if\\n\\nthe fatty liver is severe.\\n\\ny Fat cows (Body Condition Score greater than 3.5) are much more prone to fatty liver. (Please\\n\\nsee chapter on Body Condition Scoring)\\n\\ny It is an important economic disease especially in high yielders because cows that develop\\n\\nfatty liver are affected by multiple metabolic and infectious diseases.\\n\\nSYMPTOMS\\n\\ny Lower milk yields\\n\\ny Depressed appetite\\n\\ny Incidences of milk fever, ketosis, mastitis, retained fetal membranes etc\\n\\ny Reduced fertility\\n\\ny This condition can be detected by blood tests.\\n\\ny Mortality can be high.\\n\\nPREVENTION\\n\\ny There is no proven treatment for fatty liver.\\n\\ny Ensuring that cows are calving at the correct body\\n\\ncondition would prevent the breakdown of fat and\\n\\nfatty liver.\\n\\ny An ideal body condition score to calve would be\\n\\nbetween 3 to 3.5 Cows should be dried of at this\\n\\nscore and weight maintained through the dry\\n\\nperiod.\\n\\ny Changing diets during this period should be\\n\\navoided.\\n\\ny Consult a veterinarian immediately if the above\\n\\nsymptoms are seen.\\n\\ny Glucose supplements can be given to overfat animals as preventive measure.\\n\\ny Minimising stress is important for prevention of fatty liver. Sudden changes in environment\\n\\nshould be avoided.\\n\\nDISEASES THAT OCCUR DUE TO FAULTY FEEDING\\n\\nThe digestive system of cattle is highly complex\\n\\nwith the stomach having four chambers. The\\n\\ndigestive process is based on the action of\\n\\nvarious types of microbes which break down\\n\\nthe feed and provide nutrients to the animal.\\n\\nAny sudden change in feeding pattern or an\\n\\nimproper feeding regimen is bound to disturb\\n\\nthe balance of the various types of microbes,\\n\\nleading to an over population of certain\\n\\nunfavourable microbes that may cause various\\n\\nproblems like laminitis or even death in severe\\n\\ncases (acute acidosis). Such conditions may\\n\\nalso arise from interference in the process\\n\\nof natural gas expulsion produced as a bye\\n\\nproduct of microbial digestion. It is important\\n\\nto understand the common conditions so that\\n\\ntimely advice or treatment can be sought from\\n\\na veterinarian. The following conditions are\\n\\ndescribed under this section:\\n\\nA. Bloat\\n\\nB. Rumen acidosis\\n\\nC. Sub-Acute Ruminal Acidosis (SARA)\\n\\nD. Laminitis\\n\\nA. BLOAT\\n\\ny Bloat is a form of indigestion marked by excessive accumulation of gas in the rumen.\\n\\ny Bloat can occur when the animal grazes on lush young pasture, particularly if the pasture is\\n\\nwet. Some plants, e.g. clover, lucerne and alfalfa are especially dangerous in causing bloat\\n\\nbut any fast growing plants can cause it.\\n\\ny Choking due to foreign objects (esophageal obstruction) will also cause bloat by preventing\\n\\ngas release and causing accumulation of gas in the rumen.\\n\\ny Sometimes feeding of leftover food such as dry bread can cause bloat.\\n\\nSYMPTOMS OF BLOAT\\n\\ny The left flank balloons out.\\n\\ny The animal kicks its belly or stands with its\\n\\nback legs wide apart.\\n\\ny It has difficulty in breathing.\\n\\ny In severe cases, death occurs due to\\n\\nasphyxiation.\\n\\nBloating can be mild to fatal\\n\\nPREVENTION AND TREATMENT\\n\\ny Avoid moving animals to wet pasture in the morning.\\n\\ny Do not allow very hungry animals to graze a pasture. Offer dry, cut grass first before\\n\\nturning out to graze.\\n\\ny Home remedies may be used in mild cases.\\n\\ny In severe cases, puncturing the left flank with a sharp knife to release the gas is necessary,\\n\\nit will be necessary for you to act quickly as any hesitation could lead to the death of\\n\\nthe animal.\\n\\nPoint for puncturing in the left flank\\n\\nHome remedies for adult animals\\n\\ny Drench coconut/vegetable /peanut oil:\\n\\n300-500ml once a day for 2-3 days till\\n\\nrecovery. Or;\\n\\ny Above plus 30-40 ml turpentine oil. Or;\\n\\ny Drench 1 tablespoon of detergent in half\\n\\nlitre of water once. Or;\\n\\ny Feed 4-6 banana leaves (mild bloat)\\n\\nB. RUMEN ACIDOSIS\\n\\ny Acidosis may be clinical or sub\\n\\nclinical.\\n\\ny Feeding large quantities of rapidly\\n\\ndigestible carbohydrate in a short\\n\\nperiod of time causes clinical\\n\\nacidosis.\\n\\ny In severe clinical cases, animals\\n\\nmay be recumbent within 24-48\\n\\nhours, which may resemble cases\\n\\nof milk fever. Animal may not\\n\\nurinate or pass dung.\\n\\ny Sub-clinical acidosis is seen as\\n\\na result of feeding increased\\n\\nconcentrates compared to forage.\\n\\ny In sub-clinical acidosis there is reduced feed intake, weight loss, unexplained diarrhoea and\\n\\nexhaustion. This may also lead to laminitis and lameness.\\n\\ny In severe clinical cases, prognosis may not be good. Some animals though appear to improve,\\n\\nmay become seriously ill 3-4 days later.\\n\\nPREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ACIDOSIS\\n\\ny Proper feeding practices should be adopted after consulting a veterinarian.\\n\\ny Animal should be provided a roughage diet in the mornings before feeding concentrates so\\n\\nthat adequate quantities of saliva is produced.\\n\\ny Never provide the animal with large quantities of rapidly digestible carbohydrates.\\n\\ny A veterinarian must be consulted immediately in case of clinical acidosis.\\n\\nC. SUB-ACUTE RUMINAL ACIDOSIS (SARA)\\n\\ny Occurs due to excessive acid production(usually not lactate unlike acidosis) due to abrupt\\n\\nswitch from high fibre diets to higher concentrate diets.\\n\\ny Major cause of reduced production efficiency.\\n\\ny Mainly due to improperly balanced or mixed rations, low fibre content or particle size.\\n\\nSYMPTOMS\\n\\ny (i) Reduced feed intake (ii)reduced rumination (iii) mild diarrhoea (iv) foamy faeces (v)\\n\\nappearance of undigested >6mm particles in faeces (vi) depressed milk fat.\\n\\ny Secondary effects : (i) Laminitis (ii) weight loss (iii) poor body condition despite adequate\\n\\nenergy intake.\\n\\nD. LAMINITIS\\n\\ny Commonly seen in mature dairy cows during peak lactation, often a herd issue.\\n\\ny Higher concentrate/protein, low forage, mastitis, metritis , acidosis etc predispose.\\n\\ny Occurs in sub-clinical, acute and chronic form.\\n\\ny Rough irregular flooring , lack of enough lying space also predispose to the disease.\\n\\nSole ulcer in sub-clinical\\n\\nlaminitis\\n\\nCross leg in acute\\n\\nlaminitis\\n\\nHoof deformity in chronic\\n\\nlaminitis\\n\\nPREVENTION OF LAMINITIS\\n\\ny Provide soft flooring.\\n\\ny Provide balanced feed which includes sufficient forage.\\n\\ny Practice foot bath using  5% copper sulphate for 2-4 days\\n\\ncontinuously every fortnight.\\n\\ny Arrange for regular hoof trimming at least once in 6 months.\\n\\ny Adequate lying space should be provided to avoid excessive\\n\\nstanding.\\n\\ny Check hoofs regularly for any injury and signs of laminitis\\n\\nMASTITIS AND DISEASES OF TEATS\\n\\nMastitis is a scourge that result in heavy losses\\n\\nto the dairy farmer by causing a reduction in\\n\\nmilk production, drastic decrease or cessation of\\n\\nproduction, causing permanent damage to the\\n\\nudder or, even death of the animal in severe cases.\\n\\nPure exotic breeds like HF, Jersey etc have the highest\\n\\nsusceptibility to mastitis followed by crossbreds. The\\n\\nlower susceptibility of local breeds is basically due\\n\\nto its lower milk production and a better immunity\\n\\nlevels. Buffaloes are the least susceptible to mastitis.\\n\\nWith more farmers taking to crossbreeding for\\n\\nhigher production, the prevalence of mastitis is also\\n\\non the rise. Preventing the occurrence of mastitis\\n\\nwould therefore play a pivotal role in making milk\\n\\nbusiness profitable. A proper understanding of the\\n\\nmastitis will go a long way in reducing the incidence\\n\\nat the farmers’ homestead.\\n\\nDiseases of the teat may not lead to production losses\\n\\ndirectly, but indirectly there could be a decrease in\\n\\nyield due to difficulty in milking and pain caused by\\n\\nthe lesions. This may also predispose the animal to\\n\\nmastitis. The following chapters are described here:\\n\\nA. Clinical mastitis\\n\\nB. Chronic mastitis\\n\\nE. Teat warts\\n\\nF. Ulcerative mammillitis\\n\\nC.  Sub-clinical mastitis G. Pseudocowpox\\n\\nD.  Mastitis in heifer\\n\\nA. ACUTE MASTITIS\\n\\nIt is the severe inflammation of udder where physical changes are clearly visible in udder\\n\\nand milk. High yielding animals are more prone. Mainly caused by bacteria (more than 100\\n\\ntypes). Also caused by fungi, virus & rarely by algae.\\n\\nMAJOR PRE-DISPOSING FACTORS\\n\\nUnclean animal/shed\\n\\nFaulty milking practices\\n\\nMAJOR SYMPTOMS\\n\\nTeat/ udder Injury\\n\\nInflammed udder in clinical mastitis\\n\\nPhysical changes of milk in clinical mastitis\\n\\nPREVENTION\\n\\ny Manage the pre-disposing factors of mastitis properly.\\n\\ny Before milking, clean the udder well with clean water and wipe dry with clean towel. Should\\n\\nuse separate cloth towel for each animal. Disposable paper towel is also an option. Repeated\\n\\nuse of unclean towel may itself predispose to mastitis.\\n\\ny Milking should be quick, complete and hygienic.\\n\\ny Milk animals with chronic mastitis in the end. (see chapter on this)\\n\\ny Carry out teat dipping or spray immediately after milking.\\n\\ny Prevent the animal from sitting for at least 30-45 minutes after milking.\\n\\ny Periodically check and treat for sub-clinical mastitis (see chapter on this).\\n\\ny Keep the floor of the cattle shed without holes and as dry as possible.\\n\\ny Continue teat dipping/spray 2 weeks after drying off and start the practice two weeks before\\n\\ncalving.\\n\\ny Carry out proper fly control.\\n\\nTREATMENT\\n\\ny Contact a veterinarian immediately. Early treatment (within 2-3 hours) improves the chances\\n\\nof cure, delayed treatment may cause loss of udder or even death of animal.\\n\\ny Milk of animal suffering from mastitis should be discarded at least for 4 days after the\\n\\ntreatment is over or as directed by the veterinarian.\\n\\nB. CHRONIC MASTITIS\\n\\ny A persistent infection of udder.\\n\\ny Exists most of the time in the subclinical form.\\n\\ny Occasionally can develop into the clinical form before returning to the subclinical.\\n\\ny This results in hard lumps in the udder.\\n\\nMAJOR PRE-DISPOSING FACTORS\\n\\ny Neglected sub\\n\\nclinical mastitis\\n\\ny Improper treatment\\n\\nprotocol of acute\\n\\nmastitis\\n\\ny Unhygienic shed\\n\\nMAJOR SYMPTOMS\\n\\nThe affected udder may\\n\\natrophy or may lead\\n\\nto fibrosis leading to\\n\\ndecreased or total loss\\n\\nof production in the\\n\\naffected quarter.\\n\\nChances of recovery\\n\\nof chronically affected\\n\\nquarters are very low\\n\\nonce atrophy/fibrosis\\n\\nhas occurred.\\n\\nUnhygienic shed Improper treatment of mastitis\\n\\nB. CHRONIC MASTITIS\\n\\ny A persistent infection of udder.\\n\\ny Exists most of the time in the subclinical form.\\n\\ny Occasionally can develop into the clinical form before returning to the subclinical.\\n\\ny This results in hard lumps in the udder.\\n\\nMAJOR PRE-DISPOSING FACTORS\\n\\ny Neglected sub\\n\\nclinical mastitis\\n\\ny Improper treatment\\n\\nprotocol of acute\\n\\nmastitis\\n\\ny Unhygienic shed\\n\\nAtrophy of quarters due to chronic mastitis Fibrosis and hardening\\n\\nof quarter due to chronic\\n\\nmastitis\\n\\nPREVENTION\\n\\ny Separate the affected cow from rest of the herd since they remain a source of infection for\\n\\nhealthy animals. Milk chronically affected cows in the end.\\n\\ny Screen regularly for sub clinical mastitis and treat positive animals.\\n\\ny Shed hygiene is of prime importance.\\n\\nTREATMENT\\n\\ny Antimicrobial treatment is usually not effective.\\n\\ny It is better to dispose off such chronically affected animals.\\n\\nC. SUB-CLINICAL MASTITIS (SCM)\\n\\ny Most prevalent form of mastitis - causes about 70% of the losses due to mastitis.\\n\\ny Causes heavy losses due to its prolonged effect throughout lactation.\\n\\ny The other forms of mastitis (clinical or chronic) develop from this stage.\\n\\nSYMPTOMS\\n\\ny No specific symptom seen except a  slight decrease in milk production.\\n\\ny Cannot be normally detected since there is no physical changes in udder or milk.\\n\\nDETECTION OF SCM\\n\\nCalifornia Mastitis Test\\n\\nStrip cup test\\n\\ny CMT - Equal quantities of milk and CMT reagent are mixed by rotating, SCM milk will form a\\n\\ngel. CMT reaction may disappear within 20 seconds , readings must therefore be taken fast.\\n\\nAlso check each quarter separately.\\n\\ny CMT may give false positive reaction in very early (less than 10 days) lactation or when\\n\\nanimal is almost dry.\\n\\ny Strip cup test - Small flakes are present in SCM milk when viewed against a black surface,\\n\\nsize of flakes increase with the degree of SCM.\\n\\ny Paper test -  Green colour is indicative of SCM.\\n\\ny Field mastitis test - Can be carried out like CMT using using concentrated  detergent solution\\n\\ninstead of CMT reagent.\\n\\nPREVENTION OF  SCM\\n\\ny All the points mentioned for prevention of ‘clinical mastitis’ are relevant here too.\\n\\ny Test for the occurrence of SCM in your animals at least once a week.\\n\\ny Each quarter should be separately tested.\\n\\ny Newly purchased animals should be tested first for SCM and treated if found positive before\\n\\nmixing them with the herd.\\n\\ny SCM positive animal (s) should always be milked at the end.\\n\\ny If animals are tethered in open, change places frequently.\\n\\ny Ideally, no lubricant should be used during milking. If used, it should be heated daily before use.\\n\\nTREATMENT\\n\\ny Consult a veterinarian for proper treatment.\\n\\ny The chances of curing SCM is much higher than a clinical or chronic case.\\n\\ny Timely treatment of SCM will also reduce the chances of clinical and chronic cases of mastitis\\n\\nD. MASTITIS IN HEIFERS\\n\\ny Traditionally heifers have been thought of as a group free of mastitis which is not true.\\n\\ny Routine visual and manual examination of the developing udder, mammary fluid and teat\\n\\nskin to identify swollen quarters and abnormal secretions (clots and flakes) help to detect\\n\\nheifer mastitis.\\n\\ny Heifers with teat scabs and abrasions also are likely to be infected and should be treated\\n\\nwith advice from a veterinarian.\\n\\nPREVENTION AND CONTROL\\n\\ny Calves should receive early, adequate colostrum intake and be removed from the dam as\\n\\nsoon as possible.\\n\\ny If calves are grouped, they should be kept separate for at least one hour after feeding.\\n\\ny Watch for suckling of heifers: Remove any calf from a group that sucks on other calves.\\n\\ny Use fly control measures to minimize skin and teat fly strikes.\\n\\ny Pay attention to environmental conditions. Avoid wet, bacteria-laden areas for resting areas\\n\\nindoors and outdoors.\\n\\ny Maintain adequate nutrition without over-conditioning heifers.\\n\\ny Mineral mixture should be fed in adequate quantities for boosting the udder immune system.\\n\\ny The critical time to prevent new infections is the last seven days before calving\\n\\nDISEASES OF TEAT\\n\\ny Various conditions affect the teat causing difficulty in milking and some may even be\\n\\ntransmitted to the milker’s hands.\\n\\nE. TEAT WARTS\\n\\ny Teat warts are caused by virus and heifers are more prone to infection.\\n\\ny Teat warts may appear as fleshy lumps or they may be of the feathery type.\\n\\ny Teat warts are generally more of\\n\\nan unsightly appearance issue\\n\\nrather than a serious physical\\n\\nproblem. But may hamper milking.\\n\\nFeathery teat warts\\n\\nTREATMENT\\n\\nFleshy teat warts\\n\\ny Treatment is not usually required, as most warts eventually regress spontaneously.\\n\\ny Surgical removal is possible but may lead to recurrence.\\n\\ny Removal should only be done on mature growths, since removing warts too soon can\\n\\nstimulate the growth and spread the virus.\\n\\ny Large pedunculated warts can be removed slowly by tying a ligature around the base. The\\n\\nwart will dry up and fall off within a month.\\n\\ny Consult a veterinarian for further advice on treatment.\\n\\nPREVENTION\\n\\ny Disinfection of stalls etc, can reduce transmission.\\n\\ny The virus is thought to be transmitted by flies, so fly control is also important.\\n\\nF. ULCERATIVE MAMMILLITIS\\n\\ny Ulcerative mammillitis is a relatively uncommon condition but it\\n\\ncan spread rapidly in herds which are affected for the first time and\\n\\ncause significant pain and discomfort.\\n\\ny It tends to occur most commonly in first lactation cows.\\n\\ny It is also caused by a virus.\\n\\ny Lesions of mamillitis can spread over the entire udder and perineum.\\n\\ny Mouths of nursing calves might be affected. The clinical signs vary from\\n\\nsmall irregular fluid-filled blisters to larger areas of ulcers and scabs.\\n\\nTREATMENT\\n\\nUlcerative mammillitis\\n\\ny No specific treatment is available.\\n\\ny Infected cows should be seperated from others.\\n\\ny Iodine dips may help disinfect teats to prevent the spread of the disease.\\n\\ny An emollient udder cream can speed healing of skin.\\n\\nPREVENTION\\n\\ny Difficult to eliminate once disease occurs in the farm.\\n\\ny Proper quarantine of newly purchased animals, good hygiene on farm and controlling biting\\n\\nf\\n\\nlies can significantly reduce the disease\\n\\nG. PSEUDO COWPOX (MILKERS’ NODULE)\\n\\ny The most common infectious cause of teat disease in cattle.\\n\\ny Caused by a virus and not to be confused with cowpox, which is rare.\\n\\ny Since immunity is short-lived, cows can get infected fairly soon (often less than six months)\\n\\nafter recovering from the disease.\\n\\nSYMPTOMS\\n\\ny Initial infection causes a small area of swelling and reddening on the teat.\\n\\ny Over the next two days, the affected area elevates into an orange papule, which then scabs\\n\\nover.\\n\\ny Seven to ten days after first signs the scabs start dropping off. This often leaves a horse-shoe\\n\\nor ring shaped area, which is very characteristic of pseudocowpox.\\n\\ny Affected areas may grow together leading to scabs covering the entire length of the teat.\\n\\ny Damaged teats are usually healed around a month after first signs.\\n\\ny Lesions of\\n\\npseudocowpox is\\n\\nusually found on the\\n\\nteat. However  up to\\n\\n10% of affected cows\\n\\nmay have lesions on the\\n\\nudder skin.\\n\\ny It can spread from\\n\\ncattle to man by\\n\\ncontact. Skin infection\\n\\nin man is known as\\n\\nmilker’s nodules, and\\n\\nis a painful localised\\n\\ninfection.\\n\\nPseudocowpox\\n\\nTREATMENT\\n\\nScabs covering the teat in pseudocowpox\\n\\ny Removal of scabs  followed by  application of a suitable disinfectant .\\n\\ny Emollient teat dips and sprays  have a beneficial effect of reducing bacteria and viruses on\\n\\nteat skin.\\n\\ny Consult a veterinary doctor if above symptoms are seen.\\n\\nPREVENTION\\n\\ny Proper quarantine of newly purchased cows before introducing into the herd.\\n\\ny Proper teat dipping using iodophor is one of the most effective means of control.\\n\\ny Maintain proper hygiene in the shed.\\n\\nCOMMON POISONING CONDITIONS\\n\\nThere are a large number of plant and chemical\\n\\nagents that cause poisoning in animals. Some\\n\\nof them are fatal in nature if left untreated.\\n\\nA general awareness on the symptoms of\\n\\ncommon poisoning conditions would help\\n\\nthe farmer in seeking timely treatment. The\\n\\nfollowing conditions are described in this\\n\\nsection:\\n\\nA. Gossypol poisoning\\n\\nB. Cyanide poisoning\\n\\nC. Organophosporous poisoning\\n\\nA. GOSSYPOL POISONING\\n\\ny Occurs due to consumption of cottonseed or cottonseed products that contain excess free\\n\\ngossypol and can affect high-producing dairy cows with high feed intake.\\n\\ny Also affect other mature ruminants fed excess gossypol for long periods of time.\\n\\nSYMPTOMS\\n\\ny Irregular cycling in cows and buffaloes, reduced libido in males.\\n\\ny Weight loss, weakness, anorexia, and susceptibility to stress.\\n\\ny Adult dairy cattle may show weakness, depression, anorexia, edema of the brisket, and\\n\\ndyspnoea, and also have gastroenteritis, hemoglobinuria, and reproductive problems.\\n\\nCONTROL\\n\\ny Remove cottonseed products from the diet immediately. Severely affected animals may still\\n\\ndie even 2 weeks after stopping feeding of cottonseed products.\\n\\ny Poor weight gains in affected livestock and increased susceptibility to stress may persist for\\n\\nseveral weeks after cottonseed products are removed from the diet.\\n\\ny A high-quality diet supplemented with lysine, methionine and fat-soluble vitamins should\\n\\nbe included in supportive therapy.\\n\\ny Consult a veterinarian for further advise.\\n\\nB. CYANIDE POISONING\\n\\ny The most frequent cause of cyanide poisoning is ingestion of certain plants. These include\\n\\narrow grass, velvet grass, young plants of Sorghum species, tapioca leaves etc.\\n\\nSYMPTOMS\\n\\ny Signs occur within 15-20 minutes to a few hours after animals consume toxic forage.\\n\\ny Excitement may be displayed initially, followed by rapid & difficult respiration, excess\\n\\nsalivation. Mucous membranes are bright red but may become cyanotic later.\\n\\ny Animals stumble/struggle and collapse within an hour.\\n\\nPREVENTION & CONTROL\\n\\ny Avoid feeding grasses that cause poisoning until they are 15-18 inches tall.\\n\\ny Forage sorghums should be several feet tall before being used as fodder.\\n\\ny Animals should be turned out to new pasture later in the day only.\\n\\ny Grazing should be monitored closely during periods of environmental stress.\\n\\ny Immediate veterinary help must be sought if cyanide poisoning is suspected.\\n\\ny Treatment is very effective if given on time.\\n\\nC. ORGANOPHOSPHOROUS (OP) POISONING\\n\\ny Pesticides are used on both plants and animals to control crop pests that and to control\\n\\nticks on cattle.\\n\\ny A majority of pesticides are organophosphorous (OP) compounds which are active poisons.\\n\\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF OP POISONING IN CATTLE & BUFFALO\\n\\ny Severe depression\\n\\ny Hypersalivation\\n\\ny Frequent urination\\n\\ny Diarrhoea, colic, and dyspnoea\\n\\ny Involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation which may be visible under the skin\\n\\ny Nervousness, ataxia, apprehension, and seizures\\n\\ny Pupillary constriction\\n\\nPREVENTION AND CONTROL\\n\\ny Animal should be fed adequate water before applying liquid/spray on the animal body to\\n\\nkill ticks.\\n\\ny The fodder sprayed with insecticides should be properly washed with water before feeding\\n\\nit to the animal.\\n\\ny Apply the pesticide as directed on the label at the recommended dose and time.\\n\\ny Do not treat sick, emaciated or convalescent animals, or animals under severe stress with\\n\\npesticides for removing external parasites.\\n\\ny Generally, animals less than 3 months of age should not be treated for external parasites\\n\\nwith pesticides.\\n\\ny Keep animals away from pesticide containers (new or used) or pesticide-contaminated feed.\\n\\ny Check the label for restrictions regarding application in conjunction with other pesticides or\\n\\nanimal health products.\\n\\ny Contact a veterinarian immediately on observing the symptoms for timely treatment which\\n\\ncould save the animal\\n\\nCOMMON ZOONOTIC DISEASES\\n\\nZoonoses are diseases and infections that\\n\\nare naturally transmitted between vertebrate\\n\\nanimals and humans.\\n\\nZoonoses constitute 61% of all known\\n\\ninfectious diseases. It may also be noted that\\n\\nout of the 175 diseases considered to be\\n\\nemerging, 75% are zoonotic.\\n\\nPoor hygiene, poverty, malnutrition, lack of\\n\\neducation, close contact with animals are\\n\\npredisposing factors causing zoonotic diseases.\\n\\nThere are some 45 zoonotic diseases\\n\\npurported to be transmitted from cattle.\\n\\nDairy farmers who are in close contact with\\n\\ntheir animals are always at risk of acquiring\\n\\ninfections from animals, especially since most\\n\\nof these diseases are prevalent in animals in\\n\\nour country. It is important that the farmer\\n\\nis aware of these diseases which could help\\n\\nhim seek appropriate advice or treatment\\n\\nfrom a doctor. This section briefly describes\\n\\nthe following zoonotic diseases that can be\\n\\ntransmitted by cattle:\\n\\nA. Human Brucellosis\\n\\nB. Human Tuberculosis\\n\\nC. Leptospirosis\\n\\nD. Gastro-intestinal zoonotic diseases\\n\\nE. Tick borne zoonotic disease\\n\\nA. HUMAN BRUCELLOSIS\\n\\ny Brucellosis is considered to be a significant public health problem in India.\\n\\ny Fewer than 10% of the human cases of brucellosis in India may be clinically recognized and\\n\\ntreated or reported.\\n\\ny Most common symptoms are intermittent fever, joint pain and swelling , sweating, dizziness,\\n\\nheadaches, chest and abdominal pain etc, though there are a wide range of symptoms that\\n\\ncan be seen.\\n\\ny Humans get infection by drinking raw milk of infected animal or by contact with infected\\n\\nsecretions through skin or mucous membranes, especially conjunctiva. (See chapter D in\\n\\nSection IV on Bovine Brucellosis)\\n\\ny Accidental injection with S 19 vaccine could also lead to infection.\\n\\nB. HUMAN TUBERCULOSIS\\n\\ny The disease in humans caused by bovine TB (bTB) (see Chapter B of Section V for bTB) and\\n\\nhuman TB bacteria are identical with respect to clinical symptoms and lesions and would\\n\\nrequire complex tests to distinguish them.\\n\\ny The importance of human TB bacterium as a reverse zoonosis (causing infection in animals)\\n\\nis also gaining prominence with reports humans and bovines respectively having mixed\\n\\ninfections with both bTB and human TB organisms.\\n\\ny There may be no symptoms till the disease is quite advanced. The common symptoms are\\n\\ncough, loss of weight, poor appetite etc.\\n\\ny Humans get the infection by drinking contaminated milk from infected animals or by close\\n\\ncontact with infected animals.\\n\\nC. LEPTOSPIROSIS\\n\\ny Cattle are one of the principal hosts for Leptospirosis.\\n\\ny Infection in humans is most likely to occur by contact with contaminated urine or uterine\\n\\ncontents and by milking infected cattle. Infection rate is also higher in monsoon months.\\n\\ny The most common symptoms are fever, headache, nausea , vomiting, diarrhoea , jaundice ,\\n\\nbody rashes etc.\\n\\nD. GASTRO-INTESTINAL ZOONOTIC DISEASES\\n\\ny There are various zoonotic diseases affecting the intestinal tract. Some examples are\\n\\ninfections with Salmonella, E.Coli, Campylobacter, Rota virus, Cryptosporidia and Giardia.\\n\\ny The infection occurs through the faecal-oral route which is always a possible route of\\n\\ncontamination in the rural environs where close contact with cattle is common.\\n\\ny The young, malnourished, immuno-compromised and pregnant women are usually more\\n\\nsusceptible.\\n\\ny The common symptoms in gastro-intestinal zoonotic diseases are fever, diarrhoea, loss of\\n\\nappetite , weight loss, dehydration etc.\\n\\nE. TICK BORNE ZOONOTIC DISEASES\\n\\ny Tick-borne infections have been reported from various regions of our country and are a\\n\\ngroup of zoonotic diseases that requires attention.\\n\\ny They may be difficult to diagnose due to their non-specific signs and symptoms.\\n\\ny The possibility of these infections being prevalent cannot be discounted with people living\\n\\nin close proximity with cattle (with moderate to high loads of ticks on them). Babesiosis,\\n\\nRickettsial infections and Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) are some of the\\n\\nexamples of tick borne infections.\\n\\nBREEDING AND RELATED ACTIVITIES\\n\\nSelective breeding of cattle and buffalo to increase\\n\\nmilk production has been going on for a long\\n\\ntime in our country and has made commendable\\n\\nprogress in certain areas. Majority of the cattle\\n\\nand buffalo are still not included in the breed\\n\\nimprovment programmes and that is why they\\n\\nare low milk producers. In order to increase the\\n\\nmilk production in our country, there is a need to\\n\\nincrease the production potential of non-descript\\n\\nlocal animals through scientific methods like\\n\\ncrossbreeding. Along with this, improving the milk\\n\\nproduction potential of indigenous breeds in their\\n\\nnative breeding tracts is also equally important.\\n\\nProgeny testing (PT) and Pedigree Selection (PS)\\n\\ncoupled with Artificial Insemination (AI) and  milk\\n\\nrecording have been identified as activities leading\\n\\nto steady genetic progress. For a profitable milk\\n\\nbusiness, it is also necessary for the cow/buffalo to\\n\\ncalve every 1 to 1.5 years. The following chapters\\n\\nwould provide a good idea on the various aspects\\n\\nof breeding:\\n\\nA. Signs of heat, proper time of insemination.\\n\\nB. Advantages of artificial insemination (AI).\\n\\nC. Drying off a milking animal.\\n\\nD. Normal Calving and dystocia.\\n\\nE. Infertility and management of infertility\\n\\nF. A brief on Progeny Testing (PT)\\n\\nG. A Brief on Pedigree Selection (PS)\\n\\nA. HEAT\\n\\ny Heat is a period in which female animal shows interest in other animals.\\n\\ny Generaly adult heifer/cow/buffalo comes in heat after every 21 days but may come in heat\\n\\nany time between 18/24 days.\\n\\ny This period may last from 6 to 30 hours.\\n\\ny To maximize productive life of a cow, it must be inseminated within 60- 90 days after calving.\\n\\nThis will enable the cow to produce one calf per year.\\n\\ny Longer calving intervals have detrimental effects on lifetime milk production.\\n\\ny Heat detection is therefore  a critical component of good reproductive management.\\n\\ny Recording the dates of cows in heat and dates of services is necessary to predict future heat\\n\\nor calving dates and to manage the cows accordingly.\\n\\nSIGNS OF HEAT\\n\\ny Repeated bellowing.\\n\\ny Lifting of tail.\\n\\ny Swollen vulvar lips and redness of vaginal\\n\\npassage due to congestion.\\n\\ny Thick, sticky and transparent vaginal discharge.\\n\\ny Frequent urination (Micturition).\\n\\ny Reduced feed intake and decreased milk yield.\\n\\ny Restlessness, smells other animals and mounts\\n\\non them.\\n\\ny After 10-12 hours in heat, the animal allows a\\n\\nbull or a cow to mount on her. This is the right\\n\\ntime for  carrying out AI.\\n\\nPROPER TIME OF INSEMINATION\\n\\ny Insemination (either natural service or by Artificial Insemination (AI) should be given ideally\\n\\nafter 10-12 hours, or maximum of 18 hours of first sign of heat, that is, if heat is seen in the\\n\\nevening, inseminate in the following morning. If heat persists in the following morning, another\\n\\nAI may be required on the same evening.\\n\\ny If the animal does not become pregnant, it will come into heat after 18-21 days.\\n\\ny After 21 days of insemination the animal should be observed for symptoms of heat, especially\\n\\nduring early morning and late evening hours.\\n\\ny Special care should be taken in case of buffaloes, as symptoms of heat are not very prominent\\n\\nB. ADVANTAGES OF ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION (AI)\\n\\ny Artificial Insemination (AI) is carried out by using Frozen Semen Doses (FSD) of High Genetic\\n\\nMerit (HGM), disease free bulls.\\n\\ny It prevents spread of sexually transmitted diseases.\\n\\ny During AI, diseases of reproductive organs are also diagnosed.\\n\\ny Through AI, semen from one bull can be used to inseminate many cows at a time.\\n\\ny When cow/buffalo comes in heat, the animal should be artificially inseminated with semen of\\n\\nHGM bull through trained AI Technician(AIT) instead carrying out natural service.\\n\\ny FSDs of HGM bulls may be used even after its death.\\n\\ny AI can be done at the farmers’ doorstep saving the farmer time.\\n\\ny There is speedy improvement in the breed of the animal.\\n\\ny AI is easy and cheap.\\n\\nAI being done by a trained technician at the farmer’s doorstep.\\n\\nPOST AI MONITORING\\n\\ny 21 days After AI, the animal should be observed for symptoms of heat.\\n\\ny 60 days after AI, the animal should be examined for pregnancy.\\n\\ny If the animal does not conceive even after three inseminations, consult the veterinary doctor.\\n\\n(refer chapter on infertility)\\n\\nAI is a simple and cost effective method to improve milk production\\n\\nC. DRYING-OFF AN ANIMAL\\n\\nThe dry period is the most important phase of a dairy cow’s lactation cycle. For optimal animal\\n\\nhealth and best performance in the next lactation, lactating animals should have an opportunity\\n\\nto rest and regenerate mammary tissue between lactations. During this phase, the cow and her\\n\\nudder prepares for the next lactation; hence any abnormalities during the dry period will have\\n\\na negative effect on the cow’s health and milk production after calving.\\n\\nDue to the good amount of milk they produce, the drying-off process is often more complicated\\n\\nfor dairy animals. Preparation for dry off should begin at least two weeks prior to the dry-off\\n\\ndate with a significant change in the animal’s diet. Reducing the energy content of the diet and\\n\\nfeeding primarily a high-fiber diet will reduce the nutrients available for the animal to make\\n\\nmilk; this is often all that is needed to reduce milk production to a level that makes dry off safe\\n\\nand simple.\\n\\nLength of Dry Period\\n\\nAnimals should be dry for around 60 days. If animals have prolonged dry periods, they run the\\n\\nrisk of becoming obese, experiencing obesity-related diseases and having difficulty in calving.\\n\\nProcedure for drying off\\n\\nReduce concentrate feeding on a tapering basis 2-3 weeks\\n\\nbefore drying-off\\n\\nStop concentrate feeding 1-2 weeks before drying-off\\n\\nRestrict feed intake if milk yield is above 12 litres per day\\n\\nReduce dry matter allowance to maintenance levels 3 days\\n\\nbefore planned dry-off\\n\\nStop milking abruptly.\\n\\nDo not restrict water access\\n\\nCheck dry cows visually on a daily basis after drying-off\\n\\nIdeally, cows should be kept at pasture on a maintenance diet for a week after drying-off\\n\\nD. NORMAL CALVING & DYSTOCIA\\n\\ny Calving usually takes place normally without help.\\n\\ny A sticky vaginal discharge is usually seen a day before calving.\\n\\ny In older cows the calf is usually delivered 30-50 minutes after the water bag bursts, but may\\n\\nextend up to 2 hours.\\n\\ny In heifers calving may take up to 4 hours after the water bag bursts.\\n\\ny If calving does not occur within the prescribed time after the water bag bursts, it is known\\n\\nas dystocia. In this case, it may be required to call a veterinarian.\\n\\ny If the head and two front\\n\\nlegs appear after the water\\n\\nbag breaks, there is no need\\n\\nto call a vet and calving\\n\\nusually occurs normally.\\n\\ny A gentle traction of the\\n\\ncalf in a downward arc\\n\\nby holding the front legs\\n\\nmay be done in the above\\n\\nsituation.\\n\\nIn normal calving, the head and both the\\n\\nfront legs of the calf will appear.\\n\\nImproper positioning of the calf\\n\\nduring delivery causes dystocia.\\n\\ny Never attempt to pull the calf in any other position other than the one in which both front\\n\\nlegs and head are visible (Not even if one front leg and head is visible).\\n\\ny In case an abnormal presentation is seen or nothing appears after the water bag bursts, call\\n\\na veterinarian immediately.\\n\\ny Delay in attending will further complicate the situation.\\n\\nPOST CALVING MONITORING\\n\\ny Under normal circumstances, an animal should come into heat within 45 days of delivery.\\n\\ny It is recommended to breed the animal in the subsequent oestrus after the first heat or\\n\\nwithin 60-90 days.\\n\\ny If the animal does not come into heat within a period of 60 days post calving, consult a\\n\\nveterinarian.\\n\\nE. INFERTILITY\\n\\ny Infertility is a temporary disturbance in reproductive function wherein the animal cannot\\n\\nbecome pregnant. Normally an animal with a healthy reproductive function should calve\\n\\nevery 12-14 months.\\n\\ny Infertility causes economic losses to the farmers due to delay in maturity, calving and milk\\n\\nproduction. The farmer also incurs losses by maintaining an unproductive animal.\\n\\ny Infertility may be due to various reasons like: (i) Diseases of genital organs (ii) Infectious\\n\\ndiseases (iii) Absence of heat, repeat breeding, silent heat, cystic ovary (iv) Anatomical causes\\n\\n(v) Faulty AI technique.\\n\\nMANAGEMENT OF INFERTILITY\\n\\ny Inseminate at appropriate time of the heat. (See chapter on heat detection)\\n\\ny Repeat AI may be required in cases of prolonged heat for conception to occur.\\n\\ny Close observation is required to detect silent heat, especially in buffaloes.\\n\\ny Provide proper nutrition right from birth of the animal.\\n\\ny Provide adequate quantities of mineral mixture right from birth of the animal.\\n\\ny During summer season, reduce heat stress on the animal by providing clean drinking water\\n\\nat all times and adequate shade or cooling systems.\\n\\ny Ascertain whether the personnel providing AI services is adequately qualified.\\n\\ny Consult a veterinarian if a regularly cycling animal has not conceived even after 3\\n\\ninseminations to identify the problem. Repeated inseminations may cause permanent\\n\\ndamage to the reproductive organs.\\n\\ny Animals with anatomical conditions may not conceive.\\n\\ny Infection/diseases of reproductive tract also may lead to infertility. Consult a veterinarian for\\n\\nproper advice and treatment.\\n\\nFACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONCEPTION DURING A NORMAL HEAT CYCLE\\n\\nManage infertility-ensure conception\\n\\ny Only timely heat detection is in the hands of the farmer.\\n\\ny Proper handling of semen, proper time of insemination, proper AI technique and site of\\n\\ndeposition of semen are in the hands of trained personnel (vets or AI technicians).\\n\\ny It is therefore very important to ensure that AI is being done only by trained personnel\\n\\nto avoid complications or problems later on.\\n\\ny A healthy cross bred heifer should come into heat by 18 months or earlier.\\n\\ny Buffaloes and local breeds may take more time to mature ( around 24 months).\\n\\nF. A BRIEF ON PROGENY TESTING (PT)\\n\\nPT is a scientific technique used to improve the milk production of any particular breed\\n\\nthrough selective breeding.\\n\\nSTEP 1: Best yielding cows (elite cows) in identified areas for the breed are identified and\\n\\ninseminated with semen from the best bulls available.\\n\\nElite cows of the particular breed\\n\\nSTEP 2: Male calves born to the\\n\\nelite cows are purchased from\\n\\nthe farmer after testing the dam\\n\\nand calf for certain diseases\\n\\nwith negative results.\\n\\nX\\n\\nBest bulls for the particular breed\\n\\nSelected male calves\\n\\nSTEP 4:The semen from these\\n\\nselected bulls (test bulls)\\n\\nare then used on a larger\\n\\npopulation of cows of the same\\n\\nbreed in the PT area.\\n\\nX\\n\\nTest\\n\\nBull\\n\\nSTEP 6: Based on daughters’\\n\\nperformance, “breeding value”\\n\\nof each of the test bulls are\\n\\nestimated. The top 10% of\\n\\ndaughters are also selected\\n\\nbased on lactation records.\\n\\nDaughters of test bulls\\n\\nSTEP 3:The selected male\\n\\ncalves then undergo a series\\n\\nof rigorous tests at various\\n\\nstages (pre-quarantine,\\n\\nquarantine & rearing stations)\\n\\nbefore moving to the semen\\n\\nstations. Selected male calves\\n\\nshould test negative for all\\n\\nthe tests done at all stages.\\n\\nSTEP 5:The milk yield of the\\n\\ndaughters born to test bulls\\n\\nare recorded. A minimum\\n\\ncomplete first lactation\\n\\nrecords of 100 daughters are\\n\\nrequired per test bull.\\n\\nSTEP 7: The top 10% of daughters (based on\\n\\nlactation records) and the top 10% of bulls selected\\n\\n(based on breeding value) are used to produce the\\n\\nnext generation of young bulls. Each cycle takes 6-7\\n\\nyears to complete. It is always ensured that there is\\n\\nno inbreeding in the process.\\n\\nMilk recording\\n\\nAn Holstein Friesia\\n\\nG. A BRIEF ON PEDIGREE SELECTION (PS)\\n\\nIn Pedigree Selection, bulls are evaluated solely on the basis of their dam & sire’s dam’s milk\\n\\nyield. This process is followed when a large number of animals of a breed are available in the\\n\\nnative tract but, either there is no infrastructure to provide AI or, the availability is scarce.\\n\\nSTEP 1: Identification of villages having best animals of the selected\\n\\nindigenous breed in its native tract.\\n\\nSTEP 2: Artificial Insemination (AI) network is started in the selected villages. Extension activities like\\n\\nfarmer education, fertility camps and calf rallies are carried out in selected villages with emphasis\\n\\non promoting AI.\\n\\nSTEP 3: Selected cows or buffaloes of the indigenous breed are\\n\\nmilk recorded and elite animals on the basis of milk production\\n\\nare identified.\\n\\nSTEP 4: The elite animals giving maximum amount of milk is\\n\\nartificially inseminated with the best bull of the same breed\\n\\navailable in the country. This is call nominated mating.\\n\\nSTEP 5: Male calves born to the elite cows are purchased from\\n\\nthe farmer after testing the dam and calf for certain infectious\\n\\ndiseases with negative results.\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nBest bulls\\n\\nMale calves\\n\\nSTEP 6: The selected male calves then undergo a series of rigorous tests at various stages (pre\\n\\nquarantine, quarantine & rearing stations) before moving to the semen stations. Selected male\\n\\ncalves should test negative for all the tests done at all stages.\\n\\nSTEP 7: Semen from these bulls are then used on a larger\\n\\npopulation of the same breed for faster genetic improvement\\n\\nTRADITIONAL REMEDIES FOR MINOR AILMENTS\\n\\nTraditional remedies  have been used for ages by the farmers to manage minor\\n\\nailments in their livestock. The knowledge of some alternative form of medicine that\\n\\ncould manage minor ailments till such time veterinary aid is sought is important to\\n\\nthe farmer especially in areas where services may not be readily available.\\n\\nMany of these remedies documented by various agencies like BAIF, some milk\\n\\nunions in south Karnataka, International Institute of Rural Reconstruction (IIRR),\\n\\nVivekananda Kendra etc, have been mentioned here. However it is important to note\\n\\nthat the remedies mentioned here are only suggestive in nature and may not ensure\\n\\na cure. The underlying cause of these ailments may be a disease which needs to\\n\\nbe investigated to cure the same. Veterinary advice therefore need to be sought at\\n\\nthe earliest. Illustrations of the plants are also provided for easier recognition. Some\\n\\nremedies and preparations for the following ailments are suggested:\\n\\nANIMAL NUTRITION & MANAGEMENT\\n\\nProviding balanced nutrition is the foundation for productive and profitable\\n\\nanimal husbandry. Without adequate nutrition, animals cannot express\\n\\ntheir full genetic potential nor will they be productively efficient. Low milk\\n\\nproduction, low reproductive rates, poor growth and increased illness may\\n\\nbe the result of imbalance or deficiency of nutrients. Proper balance of\\n\\nprotein, energy, vitamins and  minerals are needed in the ration of animals\\n\\nto ensure best performance with respect to production, reproduction and\\n\\nhealth. Therefore, providing nutritionally balanced ration to the animal is\\n\\nnecessary to gain economic returns from dairying.\\n\\nThe following sections are included in this part:\\n\\nSection I\\n\\n:\\n\\nFeeding of Animals\\n\\nSection II\\n\\nSection III\\n\\n:\\n\\n:\\n\\nFodder Production\\n\\nHousing of Animals\\n\\nFEEDING OF ANIMALS\\n\\nFeeding is an important aspect of dairying\\n\\nas it accounts for around 70% of total cost\\n\\nof milk production. Different types of dietary\\n\\nfeed ingredients for dairy cows and buffaloes\\n\\ninclude concentrates such as compound cattle\\n\\nfeed,  oil cakes, grains and grain byproducts\\n\\nlike brans and chunnies; cultivated green\\n\\nfodders and grasses; crop residues like straws\\n\\nand stovers. Following chapters are included\\n\\nin this section:\\n\\nA. Feeding of dairy animals.\\n\\nB. Importance of Ration Balancing Programme.\\n\\nC. Importance of compound cattle feed in\\n\\nmilk production.\\n\\nD. Importance of bypass protein feed.\\n\\nE. Importance of feeding mineral mixture.\\n\\nF. Urea Molasses Mineral Block (UMMB)– A\\n\\nfeed Supplement\\n\\nG. Importance of drinking water for dairy\\n\\nanimals.\\n\\nH. Care of pregnant animals.\\n\\nI.\\n\\nJ.\\n\\nNutritional care after calving.\\n\\nExamples of preparing Total Mixed Ration\\n\\n(TMR) for cow.\\n\\nK. Examples of preparing Total Mixed Ration\\n\\n(TMR) for buffalo\\n\\nA. FEEDING OF DAIRY ANIMALS\\n\\ny A normal adult animal should be fed 4 to 6 Kg dry and 15-20 Kg green fodder per day.\\n\\ny Legume and non-legume green fodder should be fed in 1:3 proportion.\\n\\ny Green fodder should be harvested at 50% flowering stage.\\n\\ny Surplus green fodder should be conserved in the form of  ‘hay’ or ‘silage’ .\\n\\ny Conserved fodder becomes useful during summers or when green fodder is scarce.\\n\\nLeguminous fodder\\n\\nNon-leguminous fodder\\n\\nGENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS\\n\\nCattle feed\\n\\ny To optimize milk production and to meet the nutrient requirement of animals, balanced\\n\\nfeeding using user-friendly software developed by NDDB may be adopted.\\n\\ny Animals fed only on dry fodder may be provided Urea Molasses Mineral Block as a supplement\\n\\nto the diet, depending upon its availability .\\n\\ny For body maintenance and higher efficiency of milk production, ‘compound cattle feed’ / ‘bypass\\n\\nprotein feed’ should also be given .\\n\\ny Minerals are essential for all metabolic functions of the\\n\\nbody, animals’ ration should be supplemented with area\\n\\nspecific mineral mixture .\\n\\ny Changing from one feed to another should not be sudden\\n\\nbut in a gradual manner.\\n\\ny Fodder should be chaffed before feeding, to avoid wastage\\n\\nand increase digestibility.\\n\\ny Various feed ingredients including the additives, should\\n\\nbe mixed to make Sani or total mixed ration (TMR). It\\n\\nwould be more appropriate to feed this ration in 3-4\\n\\nequally divided parts in a day. This would reduce spoilage\\n\\nand increase the digestibility.\\n\\nB. IMPORTANCE OF RATION BALANCING PROGRAMME\\n\\ny The feed given to animals usually comprises one or two locally available concentrate feed\\n\\ningredients, grasses and crop residues.\\n\\ny This leads to imbalanced feeding which means that proteins, energy, minerals and vitamins\\n\\nin the ration are either more, or less.\\n\\ny While imbalanced feeding adversely affects the health and productivity of animals in various\\n\\nways, it also reduces the net daily income to milk producers from dairying because the\\n\\npotential of milk production of animals is not fully exploited.\\n\\ny To balance the ration of animals, NDDB has developed a user-friendly software, which can\\n\\nbe used by trained and dedicated local resource persons (LRPs) identified for the area.\\n\\ny Farmers can download and use “Pashuposhan” app from google play store.\\n\\nBENEFITS OF RATION BALANCING PROGRAMME (RBP)\\n\\ny Using the locally available feed resources, ration of animals is balanced at a least cost\\n\\ny Increase in milk production with more fat and solids-not-fat\\n\\ny Increase in the net daily income\\n\\ny Improved reproduction efficiency\\n\\ny Reduction in inter-calving period, thereby increase in productive life of animals\\n\\ny Improvement in general health of animals\\n\\ny Improved growth rate in calves, leading to early maturity\\n\\ny Reduction in methane emission, a potent green house gas (GHG)\\n\\nC. IMPORTANCE OF COMPOUND CATTLE FEED IN MILK PRODUCTION\\n\\ny Cattle feed produced by the Milk Unions/Federations is a balanced source of essential\\n\\nnutrients required for body maintenance, growth and milk production.\\n\\ny It is manufactured using good quality grains, oil cakes/ meals, brans, molasses, common salt,\\n\\nminerals and vitamins.\\n\\ny It is comparatively cheaper and highly palatable to the animals.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR FEEDING CATTLE FEED\\n\\ny Cattle feed contains protein, energy, minerals and vitamins required for the growth,\\n\\nmaintenance and milk production of animals. It is advantageous to feed extra cattle feed to\\n\\npregnant animals for proper development of foetus.\\n\\ny It increases reproductive efficiency, milk production as well as fat percentage of milk.\\n\\ny Growing animals should be fed 1 to 2 kg of compound cattle feed daily.\\n\\ny Milking animals should be fed 2 kg of compound cattle feed for body maintenance and\\n\\nadditional 400 g to cows and 500 g to buffaloes for every litre of milk produced.\\n\\ny In addition to this quantity, 1 kg compound cattle feed and 1 kg good quality oil cake should\\n\\nalso be given to pregnant animals during the last two months of pregnancy.\\n\\nCattle feed is prepared from\\n\\ndifferent grains, cakes, brans,\\n\\nmolasses, salt, mineral mixture and\\n\\nvitamins\\n\\nD. IMPORTANCE OF BYPASS PROTEIN FEED\\n\\ny Proteins are essential for growth and milk production.\\n\\ny Generally, the major portion of the feed proteins is broken down in the first compartment\\n\\n(rumen) of the stomach.\\n\\ny In case of bypass protein feed, significant portion of the protein escapes break down in\\n\\nthe first compartment and goes to the later part of gastro-intestinal tract resulting into better\\n\\nutilisation of proteins in the body.\\n\\ny Bypass protein feed can be prepared using chemically treated protein  meals.\\n\\nBENEFITS OF BYPASS PROTEIN FEED\\n\\ny More nutritive feed at a cheaper price.\\n\\ny The utilisation of the dietary protein increases.\\n\\ny It improves growth and milk production.\\n\\ny If usual ‘bypass protein feed’ is not available, then 1 Kg ‘treated bypass protein supplement’\\n\\ncan be fed (half Kg in the morning and half Kg in the evening) to animals producing 8-10\\n\\nlitres of milk.\\n\\nBypass protein feed is an economical source of nutrients\\n\\nBypass protein plant Bypass protein\\n\\nE. IMPORTANCE OF FEEDING MINERAL MIXTURE\\n\\ny Minerals are essential for proper metabolic functions. Mineral mixture contains all the essential\\n\\nminerals in required quantities. Feeding area specific mineral mixture should be preferred.\\n\\nBENEFITS OF FEEDING MINERAL MIXTURE\\n\\ny Helps improving growth rate in calves.\\n\\ny Better utilization of absorbed nutrients.\\n\\ny Increases milk production in animals.\\n\\ny Improves reproductive efficiency and reduces inter-calving period.\\n\\ny Increases productive life of animals.\\n\\ny Improves immunity status.\\n\\ny Prevents metabolic diseases like milk fever, ketosis, haematuria etc., which occur around\\n\\ncalving period\\n\\nF. UREA MOLASSES MINERAL BLOCK (UMMB)– A FEED SUPPLEMENT\\n\\ny Ruminants have a special compartment in their stomach, which is called rumen. It contains\\n\\nlarge number of beneficial microorganisms, which help in digestion of  fibrous components\\n\\nof feed.\\n\\ny During scarcity of green fodder, UMMB helps the rumen microbes to multiply and thus improves\\n\\nthe digestibility of dry fodder.\\n\\nBENEFITS OF UMMB\\n\\nDry fodder supplemented with UMMB can form maintenance ration for cows and buffaloes.\\n\\nUMM Blocks Animal licking UMMB\\n\\nG. IMPORTANCE OF DRINKING WATER FOR DAIRY ANIMALS\\n\\nWater is required for :\\n\\ny Digestion of feed and fodder.\\n\\ny Distribution of absorbed nutrients to various organs.\\n\\ny Excretion of undesirable and toxic elements through urine.\\n\\ny Maintenance of body temperature.\\n\\ny Normally, an adult healthy animal requires 70 to 80 litres of water daily. Since milk contains about\\n\\n87% water, for every litre of milk produced, additional 2.5 to 3 litres water is required.\\n\\nRECOMMENDATION\\n\\ny Animal should have a free access to clean drinking water round the clock.\\n\\ny During summer, crossbred cows and buffaloes should be given bath twice daily and at least 100\\n\\nlitres of water per day to manage heat.\\n\\ny Increases dry fodder intake and\\n\\nminimizes wastage.\\n\\ny Improves the digestive\\n\\nefficiency of the animals.\\n\\ny Improves milk production and\\n\\nfat percentage.\\n\\ny It is a good source of essential\\n\\nNUTRITIONAL CARE AFTER CALVING\\n\\ny Immediately after calving, the cow/buffalo has a low appetite and will not eat as much\\n\\nfeed as the body may require.\\n\\ny Cow/buffalo undergoes a lot of stress while calving, therefore, the animal should be\\n\\ngiven light, palatable, mild laxative ration containing warm rice gruel, boiled rice/wheat\\n\\nbran, boiled millet or wheat mixed with edible oil, bypass fat, Jaggery, Soya, Asafoetida,\\n\\nMethi, Black Cumin, ginger etc. for 2 to 3 days after calving. This kind of diet is also\\n\\nhelpful in early expulsion of placenta.\\n\\ny In addition, the animal should be given tender green fodder and fresh water as much as\\n\\nit wants to drink, but do not give hot water.\\n\\ny Ensure the milking cow has constant access to clean drinking water and receives required\\n\\nquantity of Area Specific Mineral Mixture daily\\n\\nIMPORTANCE OF GREEN FODDER IN MILK PRODUCTION\\n\\nGreen fodder is an economic source of nutrients for the dairy animals. It is highly palatable and\\n\\ndigestible. Micro-organisms present in green fodder help in improving digestibility of crop\\n\\nresidues under mixed feeding system. It also helps in maintaining good health and improving\\n\\nbreeding efficiency of animals. Increased use of green fodder in the ration of animals may\\n\\nreduce cost of milk production.\\n\\nTo reduce the gap between demand and availability of green fodder, there is a need to improve\\n\\ngreen fodder yield through enhanced use of improved fodder seeds. For ensuring year round\\n\\ngreen fodder production, farmers need to adopt following agricultural practices:\\n\\ny Always use certified / truthfully labeled seed / planting material of improved high yielding\\n\\nvarieties of fodder crops.\\n\\ny Follow recommended package of practices for fodder cultivation such as land preparation,\\n\\ntimely sowing, fertilizer application, irrigation, weed and pest control and harvesting schedule.\\n\\ny Growing short duration varieties of fodder crops such as maize, sunflower, chinese\\n\\ncabbage, turnip, cowpea etc. between two main seasonal crops.\\n\\ny Cultivate cereal fodder crops like maize, bajra and sorghum along with fodder legumes like\\n\\ncowpea, cluster bean and velvet bean.\\n\\ny Cultivation of high yielding multi-cut perennial fodder crop like Hybrid Napier grass in fields and\\n\\nalso on boundaries of other crop fields.\\n\\ny Cultivate guinea grass,  a shade tolerant fodder crop along with forage legumes like  siratro\\n\\n/ stylos under mixed cropping between trees rows in orchards.\\n\\ny Harvest the multi-cut fodder crops at regular intervals (30 to 45 days) 10 cm height from\\n\\nground level to get optimum production and quality fodder.\\n\\ny Cultivate drought tolerant perennial grasses like anjan grass, sewan grass, rhodes grass and fodder\\n\\ntrees like desi babool, neem, shisam, kanchan, aaradu, khejri, subabul and Gliricidia on fallow\\n\\nlands/wastelands/community for grazing.\\n\\ny Some photos of important fodder crops and trees are provided in the following pages\\n\\nB. FODDER CONSERVATION\\n\\nFeeding quality roughages to the dairy animals throughout the year is essential to exploit their milk\\n\\nproduction potential. Generally, green fodder is available in plenty in few months like September\\n\\n/ October (monsoon season) and February / March (Rabi season) under irrigated conditions while\\n\\nits availability is limited during summer months. The surplus green fodder can be conserved in\\n\\nthe form of hay and silage to ensure supply of roughages during deficit period and to minimize\\n\\nwastage of green fodder.\\n\\nI. HAY MAKING\\n\\nHay is a sun dried green fodder, containing moisture below 15 per cent. It is a good source of digestible\\n\\ndry matter and crude protein for dairy animals during deficit periods. The best quality hay is prepared\\n\\nfrom thin stem cultivated fodder crops like Lucerne, Oats and Sweet Sudan Grass during hot and dry\\n\\nsummer months from March to May. Some perennial pasture grasses like Guinea grass, Rhodes grass,\\n\\nAnjan/Dhaman grass, Blue panic grass are also suitable for hay making.\\n\\nTo get best quality hay, these crops are cut at 50 per cent flowering stage. After cutting, green foliage\\n\\nis evenly spread on dry surface in thin layers of 5 cm thick for sun drying. Every morning after 10 A.M.\\n\\nfodder is inverted manually /mechanically for quick and evenly drying. After 4 to 5 days, when moisture\\n\\nreaches to less than 15 per cent in the forages, hay is collected and bundles are made for storage. While\\n\\ndrying, care should be taken that hay retain the leaves and green colour, as it is an indicator of good\\n\\nquality hay.\\n\\nThese bundles of hay should be stored in moisture and dust free places like bunkers/godowns to\\n\\nmaintain quality for longer period. Hay can be fed @ 5 kg per animal per day with or without chaffing\\n\\nC. UREA AMMONIA TREATMENT OF CROP RESIDUES\\n\\nIt is well known that green fodder, cattle feed and dry fodder in combination form the ideal\\n\\nnutritional source for maintaining health and milk production of animals. But sometimes due to\\n\\nnon-availability of green fodder in sufficient quantity and high price of cattle feed pose problems\\n\\nfor the farmer to meet nutritional demand of milking animals. Generally, paddy, wheat, bajra\\n\\nand sorghum straws are available in plenty with the farmers but these straws are deficient in\\n\\nnutrients and low in digestibility. Straws have less than 4 per cent protein. Urea treatment of\\n\\nstraw increases its nutritive value by raising the protein content to about 8 per cent. Feeding\\n\\nurea treated straw may reduce the cattle feed requirement up to 30 per cent.\\n\\nStraw Treatment Method:\\n\\n1. At a time at least 1 ton straw should be treated. We need 40 kg urea and 400 litres of water\\n\\nfor the treatment of 1 ton straw.\\n\\n2. Dissolve 4 kg urea in 40 litres of water.\\n\\n3. Spread 100 kg straw on the floor to form 3-4 inch thick layer.\\n\\n4. Sprinkle 40 litres of prepared urea solution on the straw using gardener’s sprinkler. Then\\n\\npress the straw with feet by walking on it.\\n\\n5. Spread another 100 kg of dry straw on top of this compressed straw, and prepare another\\n\\n40 litres of urea solution again by dissolving 4 kg urea in 40 litres of water. Sprinkle the\\n\\nprepared urea solution over the second layer of straw and repeat the compaction by walking\\n\\non the layer of treated straw. Likewise, repeat the procedure 10 times by spreading 10 layers\\n\\nof straw, sprinkling it with 4 % urea solution and then pressing with feet.\\n\\n6. Cover the treated straw heap with a new plastic sheet and spread some quantity of mud at\\n\\nthe point where it touches the ground to prevent the formed ammonia gas to escape.\\n\\n7. In case plastic sheet is not available, cover the treated heap with dry straw. Then after putting\\n\\nsome soil, cover the same with wet clay / or cow dung layer to make it airtight\\n\\nUREA AMMONIA TREATMENT OF CROP RESIDUES (contd)\\n\\nPrecautions:\\n\\ny Never feed urea or urea solution directly to the animal. Urea as such is fatal to animals.\\n\\ny While treating the straw, keep the urea solution away from the reach of animals.\\n\\ny Cemented floor is more appropriate for treatment of straw. If the floor is kaccha, use a plastic\\n\\nsheet on the floor before spreading the first layer of straw.\\n\\ny It is convenient to undertake straw treatment in a closed room or in the corner location.\\n\\ny Treated straw should be opened after 21 days in summer and 28 days in winter. Before feeding,\\n\\nthe straw should be spread in open air for the ammonia gas to escape.\\n\\ny Start with feeding small quantities of treated straw. Slowly the animal gets habituated and\\n\\nstarts relishing it.\\n\\nHOUSING OF ANIMALS\\n\\nAnimal housing is also very important in harnessing the maximum potential of the animal.\\n\\nStressful conditions significantly reduces productivity and it is therefore important to protect\\n\\nthe animal from inclement weather.\\n\\nImproper housing also predisposes the animal to hoof conditions.\\n\\nThe following chapters are included in this section:\\n\\nA.\\n\\nAnimal Housing.\\n\\nB.\\n\\nC.\\n\\nHeat Stress.\\n\\nMeasuring heat stress through symptoms.\\n\\nD. Measuring heat stress through indices.\\n\\nE.\\n\\nManaging heat stress.\\n\\nA. ANIMAL HOUSING\\n\\nIt is important to provide clean and comfortable housing facilities to the dairy animals for their\\n\\nproper growth and optimum productivity. The milch animals should be protected from extreme\\n\\nweather conditions of summer, winter, scorching direct sunrays and winds by providing proper\\n\\nanimal sheds.\\n\\nDuring summer, the animals suffer from heat stress and they become restless. Sweating and\\n\\npanting, to some extent helps them cool their bodies. Reduced feed intake of the animals results\\n\\ninto decreased milk production. Therefore, we must have a suitable housing for the animals.\\n\\ny Animal shed must ensure minimum 5.5 feet x 10 feet floor space for one cow / buffalo. The\\n\\nf\\n\\nlooring should be of rough concrete finish with 1.5% slope towards drain. The drain should\\n\\nbe open, 8 inch wide, 3 inch deep having 1.0% cross slope so that the shed remains clean.\\n\\ny Height of the ceiling should not be less than 10 feet may it be thatched or of AC Sheets,\\n\\nBrick or RCC.\\n\\ny Shed should be open from three sides. Only western side should have wall. For every animal\\n\\nthere should be ventilator of size 3 feet x 1 feet at the ceiling level. During winter remaining\\n\\nthree open sides may be covered by gunny cloth.\\n\\ny 2 feet wide and 1.5 feet deep manger should be located on western wall of the shed. Base\\n\\nof the manger may be 1 feet above the floor level. Trough for drinking water should be\\n\\nprovided by the side of the manger.\\n\\ny Eastern side of animal shed should have free loafing area. Animals are more comfortable\\n\\nunder the shade of the tree. Loafing area, therefore should have 2-3 shady trees e.g. Neem.\\n\\ny During summer, sprinkling of water on the animal at an interval of 15 to 20 minutes reduces\\n\\nheat stress as evaporation of water causes cooling of body.\\n\\nB. HEAT STRESS\\n\\nHeat stress on animals leads to productivity loss on account of following:\\n\\ny Rise in body temperature, reduced feed intake, sweating, panting, increased pulse rate,\\n\\nincreased peripheral blood flow, reduced growth hormones, high mortality, increased water\\n\\nintake, reduced  milk  production & reduced  breeding  efficiency.\\n\\ny To  combat  the ill effects of heat stress, NDDB has developed a water misting based Animal\\n\\nCooling System costing Rs 11000 for six animals.\\n\\nC. MEASURING HEAT STRESS THROUGH SYMPTOMS\\n\\ny Assessing the level of heat stress is important to prevent or reduce production losses due to\\n\\nheat stress or even prevent mortality in severe cases.\\n\\ny Scoring the levels of heat stress by the symptoms (Panting Score) shown by animals would\\n\\ngive an idea about the condition of the animals.\\n\\nBreathing condition\\n\\nNo panting– normal Difficult to see chest movement\\n\\nSlight panting, mouth closed, no drool or foam. Easy to see chest\\n\\nmovement\\n\\nFast panting, drool or foam present. No open mouth panting\\n\\nAs for 2 but with occasional open mouth, tongue not extended\\n\\nPanting\\n\\nScore\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\nOpen mouth + some drooling.

However, one should avoid vaccinating animals in\\n\\nthe last month of pregnancy, as the animal as well as the fetus could be injured during restraining.\\n\\nQuestion: Should we vaccinate unaffected animals during FMD outbreak in a village?\\n\\nAnswer: In an FMD affected village, it is not advisable to vaccinate animals not showing symptoms of FMD since\\n\\nit may already be in various stages of incubation even before any symptoms are seen. However, ring vaccination\\n\\nstarting from 2-3 km away from the infected village and moving inward from periphery to the point of infection\\n\\nis very important is limiting the spread of the disease. Strict control on movement of animals, feed, fodder and\\n\\npeople from infected areas are also equally important in controlling the outbreak.\\n\\nQuestion: Can an animal be vaccinated against several diseases at a time?\\n\\nAnswer:  Yes, in human beings and dogs, combined vaccines for multiple diseases are already in use for a long\\n\\ntime. Now combined vaccines against FMD, HS and BQ are available for cattle and buffaloes also.\\n\\nQuestion: What should we do if a rabid dog bites an animal?\\n\\nAnswer: Wash the wound immediately under running tap water for 5-10 minutes. In absence of a tap, pour clean\\n\\nwater from a vessel. Clean the wound with ordinary bath soap gently. Apply tincture iodine and take the animal\\n\\nto the nearest Veterinary Officer.\\n\\nQuestion: What should we do if a snake bites an animal?\\n\\nAnswer: Tie a tourniquet 3-4 inches above the site of the bite. Give a small incision at the site with clean blade and\\n\\nallow the wound to bleed. Wash the wound with detergent. Call the Veterinarian immediately.\\n\\nQuestion: What should we do to treat tympany/bloat?\\n\\nAnswer: Feeding of lush green leafy fodder like Berseem, lucerne may result in formation and accumulation of\\n\\ngases in the rumen causing distension of rumen. In such cases, don’t allow the animal to sit and do not provide\\n\\nwater to drink. Give the animal a mixture containing 100 gm of rock salt, 30 gms of asafoetida, 100 ml turpentine\\n\\noil and 500 ml linseed / vegetable oil and then consult a Veterinary officer immediately.\\n\\nQuestion: Is there any harm if we consume milk from a cow suffering from subclinical mastitis?\\n\\nAnswer: Milk from cows having subclinical mastitis may contain toxins of certain bacteria that are not destroyed\\n\\neven by boiling. The toxins may produce diarrhoea or throat infection in humans.\\n\\nQuestion: Is oxytocin injection given for letdown of milk harmful to animal or milk consumers?\\n\\nAnswer: Use of oxytocin injection is not recommended for milk let down except when used by a veterinarian for\\n\\ntreating animals for some diseases.\\n\\nQuestion: Should colostrum need to be fed to a new born calf?\\n\\nAnswer: Colostrum should be fed as early as possible to a new born calf in adequate quantities (minimum 1/10th\\n\\nof the body weight).\\n\\nQuestion: Can we deworm pregnant animals?\\n\\nAnswer: Pregnant animals should be dewormed near the time of calving and again 6-7 weeks after calving after\\n\\nconsultation with a veterinarian\\n\\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS– ANIMAL NUTRITION\\n\\nQuestion: What is ration balancing?\\n\\nAnswer: All species require balanced ration for optimal growth, ration balancing is a process to balance the level\\n\\nof various nutrients of an animal, from the available resources, to meet its nutrient requirements for maintenance\\n\\nand production.\\n\\nQuestion: Can we incorporate gram chuni, wheat bran, banana stem, bamboo leaf etc. and other home grown\\n\\nproduce while balancing ration?\\n\\nAnswer: Yes, home grown produce, tree leaves etc. which are normally fed to animals can be incorporated while\\n\\nbalancing ration. In fact the objective of ration balancing is to produce an optimum quantity of milk at the least cost\\n\\nfrom milch animals by readjusting, wherever required, the proportion of locally available dietary feed ingredients,\\n\\nso as to provide adequate amount of proteins, minerals, vitamins as well as energy.\\n\\nQuestion: In case UMB is being offered to the animal for licking, how much quantity of urea treated straw should\\n\\nbe fed to animal?\\n\\nAnswer: UMB and urea treated straw both should not be fed to animal at a time. If UMB is not given, we can offer\\n\\nurea treated straw to animal to the extent it eats.\\n\\nQuestion: Is cattle feed  required if we feed urea treated straw to the animal?\\n\\nAnswer: In case animal is neither pregnant nor lactating and is getting sufficient urea treated straw or ordinary\\n\\nstraw along with UMB lick, cattle feed is not required. But for lactating and pregnant animals, cattle feed/bypass\\n\\nprotein feed should also be fed along with urea treated straw as per recommendation made earlier in this booklet.\\n\\nQuestion: Do we need to provide extra mineral mixture when we are feeding balanced cattle feed to animals?\\n\\nAnswer: As balanced cattle feed contains mineral mixture, we can reduce the recommended quantity of mineral\\n\\nmixture to 50%.\\n\\nQuestion: What should we do if the animal does not lick urea molasses block?\\n\\nAnswer: To make the animal habituated to licking UMB, sprinkle flour, bran or cattle feed on the block for few days.\\n\\nAnimal will start relishing it gradually.\\n\\nQuestion: For how many days does one urea molasses block last?\\n\\nAnswer: One urea molasses block weighing 3 kg lasts for 5-7 days for one animal\\n\\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS– ANIMAL BREEDING\\n\\nQuestion: Why is improvement of indigenous breeds important? What are important indigenous breeds and\\n\\nwhere are they available?\\n\\nAnswer: Indigenous breeds are well adapted to our agro-climatic conditions and are resistant to many tropical\\n\\ndiseases and can survive and produce milk on poor feed and fodder resources. Some of these breeds are well known\\n\\nfor their high milk and fat production. However, the production potential of these animals has deteriorated over\\n\\na period of time due to lack of selection. The high producing exotic breeds do not have the above characteristics\\n\\nand are very difficult to manage in tropical Indian scenario. Hence, indigenous breeds should be improved. Please\\n\\nsee the inside covers for the various indigenous milch breeds of cattle & buffalo and their native breeding tracts.\\n\\nQuestion: Which is most suitable animal for Dairying – indigenous cattle, crossbred cattle or buffalo?\\n\\nAnswer: Choice of breed or breed combination primarily depends on resource availability, climatic conditions,\\n\\navailability of feed and fodder and healthcare facilities, availability of market for milk, criteria for milk pricing etc.\\n\\nIn resource poor situations, indigenous cattle and/or buffaloes could be preferred while with moderate to good\\n\\nresources crossbred cow could be preferred. Places where fat % is the price criteria, buffaloes may be preferred.\\n\\nQuestion: What is an economic animal?\\n\\nAnswer: Economic animal is one which produces one calf in a year, resistant to diseases; produce maximum milk\\n\\nwith minimum input cost i.e. minimal per litre milk production cost.\\n\\nQuestion: What is a state breeding policy? Why should it be followed?\\n\\nAnswer: Every state has defined its own breeding policy based on geographical and climatic conditions of the\\n\\nstate and distribution of different breeds in the state. Breeding policy is a guideline to indicate what breed and\\n\\nbreed combination like indigenous, crossbred or exotic breed is most suitable in the given agro climatic condition\\n\\nof the state. It should be followed to get the optimum output from your animals and to conserve the native breed\\n\\navailable in the state.\\n\\nQuestion: What type of semen should be used to breed different type of animals? Whether AI Technician (AIT)\\n\\ncarries semen doses of all breeds of semen so that I can choose the best option for my animal? What is sire\\n\\ndirectory? Is it available with every AIT?\\n\\nAnswer: Semen procured only from A and B graded semen stations should be used for breeding purpose . The\\n\\nsemen used should be in accordance with the breeding policy of the state. The semen doses must be carried in\\n\\ncryocan (not in any other container). All AITs may not always carry the semen as per the breeding policy of the\\n\\nstate hence an aware and progressive farmer should be vigilant and insist to know the breed, exotic blood level\\n\\nand pedigree details of the bull, the semen of which is being used to breed his animal.\\n\\nSire directory contains pedigree details of all bulls in the semen station. Ideally it should be available with AI\\n\\ntechnician. If not, the AIT should obtain it from the semen station.\\n\\nQuestion: Is Artificial Insemination (AI) a treatment for infertility/repeat breeding?\\n\\nAnswer: No, AI is not a treatment for infertility or repeat breeding. It is an artificial method to inseminate an animal\\n\\nwith semen of disease free High Genetic Merit (HGM) bull. If an animal is not able to conceive through natural\\n\\nservice due to infertility then it won’t conceive even through artificial insemination.\\n\\nQuestion: Is there any advantage of using more than one dose of semen in one heat?\\n\\nAnswer: If done at correct time of heat using good quality semen and using correct AI technique following\\n\\nStandard Operating Procedure (SOP) one dose of semen is sufficient for successful conception. However, in a few\\n\\ncases, if the heat period is extended beyond normal duration; ovulation is also delayed and in such cases, second\\n\\ninsemination may be required.\\n\\nQuestion: Should I take the animal to a bull after AI?\\n\\nAnswer: No, the animal should never be taken to a bull after AI.\\n\\nQuestion: What is the ideal success rate of AI?\\n\\nAnswer: 40% and above.\\n\\nQuestion: Is AI successful in buffaloes?\\n\\nAnswer: Yes, AI in buffaloes is as successful as in cows. However, proper care should be taken for detection of heat\\n\\nand timely insemination of buffaloes for higher conception because buffalo exhibits silent heat wherein animals\\n\\ndo not exhibit heat symptoms overtly and duration of heat is also reduced.\\n\\nQuestion: Does AI produce only male calves or weak calves or, reduce milk yield of the dam?\\n\\nAnswer: Analysing large number of observations has revealed that there is no adverse effect of AI on male: female\\n\\nratio, calf birth weight or milk production of dam. These are superstitions or myths which are propagated by vested\\n\\ninterests without any scientific evidence.\\n\\nQuestion: Which bull semen is most suitable for breeding a non-descript Indian cow to get better milk from its\\n\\nprogeny?\\n\\nAnswer: Use of semen from indigenous bulls like Sahiwal/Gir/Red Sindhi etc. is most suitable depending on\\n\\nresources or breeding policy of the state. If the farmer has resources to maintain a crossbred animal and the state\\n\\nbreeding policy permits it, he can use pure HF/Jersey semen for production of a crossbred progeny.\\n\\nQuestion: How does milk recording help the farmer in general?\\n\\nAnswer: Milk recording helps the farmer to get a complete lactation record of his animal. He also gets an idea of\\n\\nperformance of his animal as compared to the performance of other animal in his herd or village. This information\\n\\nhelps him to take a decision on managing the animal, whether to retain it, cull it or use it for production of progenies\\n\\nfor herd replacement.\\n\\nQuestion: Why are different traits such as body conformation, milk components and growth rate being measured?\\n\\nAnswer: Milk yield is not the sole criteria for judging the performance of the animal. Milk should also be tested for\\n\\nother milk components like fat, protein and lactose content as these parameters decide the market price of milk.\\n\\nBody confirmation and growth rate are highly and positively correlated to production and reproduction traits.\\n\\nQuestion: Why are my animals being tested for diseases under bull production programmes (PT & PS)?\\n\\nAnswer: For production of disease free semen, selected bull and its dam should be free from disease because\\n\\ncertain diseases are spread to other animals through semen.\\n\\nQuestion: What is sexed semen? Where it is available? What is the cost? Is it available with all AITs? How to verify\\n\\nwhether sexed semen has been used on my animal? Is it available for all breeds and for buffaloes also? What are\\n\\nthe advantages of using sexed semen over conventional semen? What is the success rate?\\n\\nAnswer: Such semen in which sperms of a single gender is present and calf of desired gender could be produced\\n\\nis called sexed semen. Its purity level is 80-90%, implying that 80-90% of the calves produced through this semen\\n\\nwill be of same gender. On the other hand, ratio of male and female calves born out of conventional semen is 50:50.\\n\\nAs of now, no semen station is manufacturing sexed semen, hence it has to be imported from foreign countries,\\n\\nbut it is now being produced by a few agencies.\\n\\nSexed semen is available at the rate of Rs.1200-2000/- per dose. However it is available at subsidized rate in a few\\n\\nStates. Please note that sexed semen is not available with all the AITs.\\n\\nFor import of sexed semen it is necessary to take permission from Animal Husbandry Department. It is also\\n\\nmandatory to maintain records of the calf produced through sexed semen.\\n\\nIt is possible to check the quality of sexed semen. If the animal is inseminated through sexed semen, the farmers\\n\\nare requested to keep the straw safely and carefully read the information printed on the straw. From the detains\\n\\nwritten on the straw, the farmer can judge whether his cow has been inseminated with sexed semen or not.\\n\\nAs of now, sexed semen is available for HF, Jersey, Gir, Sahiwal and Murrah breeds.\\n\\nBy using sexed semen, calf of desired sex may be obtained.\\n\\nAs number of sperms present in the sexed semen is less as compared to conventional semen, hence conception\\n\\nrate through sexed semen is also less by 10-20%.\\n\\nQuestion: What is embryo transfer (ET)? Is it an alternative to AI to get my cow/buffalo conceived? My cow/buffalo\\n\\nis not getting conceived in spite of repeated AI, can I use ET to get it conceived? Who can provide me ET services?\\n\\nWhat is the cost? Can I have a choice of sex of calf through ET?\\n\\nAnswer: In ET technique, the embryos produced out of elite cow and buffalo is transferred to a recipient animal\\n\\nwhich acts as a surrogate mother and carries the embryo to full term. ET is a technique to increase the reproduction\\n\\nrate of genetically superior females – to get more calves in a life time than possible through normal reproduction.\\n\\nET is being carried out by a few organisations in India namely, SAG, Bidaj (Gujarat), PBGSBS, Haringhata (West\\n\\nBengal), PLDB, Chandigarh, (Punjab), ULDB, Dehradun (Uttarakhand) and BAIF, Pune (Maharashtra) to produce\\n\\nHGM bulls for semen production. ET services cannot be provided at farmer’s level on individual basis however the\\n\\nsame may be conform with the above organisations.\\n\\nCost of ET may be estimated through breed of the embryo, its quality, successful conceptions etc.\\n\\nAdvantages of sexed semen may be taken to determine the sex of calf produce through ET.\\n\\nAn embryo cannot be transferred using an AI gun and requires specialized skills and transfer equipment. Therefore,\\n\\ndo not believe if a person claims to have an embryo and proposes to transfer it into your animal.
